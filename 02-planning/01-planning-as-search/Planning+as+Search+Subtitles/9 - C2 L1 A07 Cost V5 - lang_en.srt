1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,469
Before I can incorporate any guidance about how to make useful progress towards the goal,

2
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:07,650
I need to add the notion of a cost function to my search process.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,890
Up to this point,

4
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:11,415
I have assumed that every action had the same cost,

5
00:00:11,414 --> 00:00:13,469
and I've been assuming that the length of

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,245
the plan was exactly the same thing as the cost of a plan.

7
00:00:16,245 --> 00:00:18,095
But that might not be the case.

8
00:00:18,094 --> 00:00:20,535
Some actions might actually cost more than others.

9
00:00:20,535 --> 00:00:22,500
For instance, in our grid example,

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,289
you've seen plans that consist of motions moving right,

11
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:27,359
left, up, and down.

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,210
But what about diagonal actions?

13
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,295
Well, in the simplest sense,

14
00:00:31,295 --> 00:00:34,800
a diagonal motion on a grid traverses a distance of square root two,

15
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,789
compared to lateral and vertical motions that traverse a distance of one.

16
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:40,439
We could say that in this case,

17
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:42,089
diagonal motions have a cost of root two.

18
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,190
With a cost function,

19
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:48,085
which is really just the cost associated with all the actions and a partial plan,

20
00:00:48,085 --> 00:00:53,100
I can add up these costs and use them as a way to compare different plans.

21
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,195
If my ultimate goal is to find the lowest cost plan as part of a search process,

22
00:00:57,195 --> 00:01:01,034
then instead of expanding the shortest plan or the most recent plan,

23
00:01:01,034 --> 00:01:04,090
I could be thinking about expanding the lowest cost plan.

24
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:07,530
This particular algorithm is called uniform cost and it's guaranteed

25
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,730
to find the lowest cost plan first as part of the search process.

26
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,010
Next, we'll look at how to incorporate your map

27
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,000
of the environment in guiding the search process.
