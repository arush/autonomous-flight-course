1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,315
Planning is a core capability of any autonomous vehicle.

2
00:00:03,315 --> 00:00:06,273
But in reality, it's also central to your everyday life.

3
00:00:06,273 --> 00:00:09,240
Before you leave your house to go somewhere, you make a plan.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,660
In many cases, it might not even occur to you that you've made a plan.

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:14,820
But, in fact, throughout the day,

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,490
you're coming up with a detailed series of actions you need

7
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:20,355
to take to get from wherever you are to wherever you're going.

8
00:00:20,355 --> 00:00:22,740
Flying cars operate in much the same way.

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:26,850
Suppose your flying car is located somewhere in the city and

10
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:31,020
is tasked with flying to some other location or series of locations.

11
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,885
Before setting out, it needs to make a plan,

12
00:00:33,885 --> 00:00:36,210
which will require making decisions about

13
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,640
which path to take based on where obstacles or

14
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,795
no fly zones are and any other factors you want to take into account.

15
00:00:42,795 --> 00:00:47,145
For example, you might want your flying car to focus on fuel efficiency,

16
00:00:47,145 --> 00:00:52,455
or speed, or maybe even take the smoothest possible path to ensure passenger comfort.

17
00:00:52,455 --> 00:00:55,470
Even more complicated, the flying car

18
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:58,410
might not know everything about the state of the world ahead of time.

19
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,690
A good planner might consider

20
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,935
possible contingencies and take various uncertainties into account.

21
00:01:04,935 --> 00:01:09,825
Finally, there's more to planning than simply navigating and finding motion plans.

22
00:01:09,825 --> 00:01:12,291
For example, for delivery vehicles,

23
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:15,253
there are decisions to be made about what order to make deliveries,

24
00:01:15,253 --> 00:01:17,770
when to return home for fuel, and so on.

25
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:21,475
In this module, we'll focus on the 3D motion planning problem.

26
00:01:21,475 --> 00:01:25,180
But in later modules, we'll look at these higher level mission planning problems.

27
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,270
All of these things taken together form the planning problem.

28
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,576
And at the end of the day,

29
00:01:29,576 --> 00:01:31,480
solving the planning problem mostly comes

30
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,135
down to setting up what's known as your search space,

31
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:37,020
and then conducting a search through that space.

32
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,025
In this module, I'll be showing you how to represent

33
00:01:40,025 --> 00:01:44,765
the 3D motion planning problem and how to conduct a search to find a viable plan.

34
00:01:44,765 --> 00:01:49,130
We'll start off by solving some relatively simple two-dimensional planning problems,

35
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:53,330
and we'll talk about different ways to solve these problems efficiently.

36
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:56,720
However, 3D motion planning makes us think

37
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,050
about how we actually represent the vehicle and the world,

38
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,705
and we'll look at different representations.

39
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:05,930
Air vehicles often have complex dynamics.

40
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,120
They can't always move in arbitrary ways.

41
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,350
And we'll look at putting the dynamic constraints of the vehicle into the planner.

42
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:15,450
Finally, we'll examine some practical considerations to

43
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,945
keep in mind when executing a plan within a finite state machine.

44
00:02:18,945 --> 00:02:20,490
At the end of these lessons,

45
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,010
you'll get to test your skills by implementing

46
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,540
a 3D path planning algorithm for your quadcopter.
