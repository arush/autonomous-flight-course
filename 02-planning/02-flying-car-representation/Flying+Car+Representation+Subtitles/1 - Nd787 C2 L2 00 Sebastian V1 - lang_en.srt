00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,094
Okay. Today my job is to make you think like a drone.

2
00:00:04,094 --> 00:00:08,040
You might think a drone moves in a three-dimensional space x,

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,905
y, and z, and that is correct.

4
00:00:10,905 --> 00:00:13,470
But on top of it, there's more state variables,

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,040
they're called rotation angles.

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,480
There is pitch, there's row,

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,400
and the third one is yaw,

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,100
where the drone rotates on its own center.

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,955
These three rotation angles are the subject of what we're going to do next.

10
00:00:26,955 --> 00:00:29,429
We're going to look into all angles,

11
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:33,300
rotation matrices, and something completely crazy,

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,570
something called quaternions. Have fun.
