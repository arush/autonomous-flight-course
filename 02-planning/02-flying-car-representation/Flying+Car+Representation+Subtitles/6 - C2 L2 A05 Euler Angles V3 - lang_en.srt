1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,889
The most common representation for

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:04,979
three dimensional orientation is through what are called Euler angles,

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,925
named after the famous 18th century mathematician Leonhard Euler.

4
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:14,540
Euler angles are usually given as roll, pitch, and yaw.

5
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:18,449
And they specify the attitude or orientation of a vehicle,

6
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:20,500
or any other rigid body for that matter,

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,612
as a sequence of rotations about the axes of the body-frame coordinate system.

8
00:00:24,611 --> 00:00:29,414
So, here I have a vehicle and my body-frame coordinate system looks like this,

9
00:00:29,414 --> 00:00:31,769
with positive x toward the front of the vehicle,

10
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:33,744
positive y out the right hand side,

11
00:00:33,744 --> 00:00:35,829
and positive z pointing down.

12
00:00:35,829 --> 00:00:38,070
In the body frame, you can think of roll as

13
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,905
the counterclockwise rotation about the positive x-axis.

14
00:00:40,905 --> 00:00:44,160
So I tell you that the vehicle rolled positive 30 degrees.

15
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:47,669
I mean that looking down from above the positive x direction,

16
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,090
this maneuver appears as a counterclockwise rotation of the vehicle.

17
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,400
Also, it's really important that we all agree that

18
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:56,109
rotations are always counterclockwise around the axis.

19
00:00:56,109 --> 00:00:58,439
You can think of this as a right handed rule.

20
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:01,484
If your right handed thumb points along the axis of rotation,

21
00:01:01,484 --> 00:01:05,069
positive rotations are in the directions that your fingers curl.

22
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:08,039
The same convention applies for the other two Euler angles.

23
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:11,430
Namely, pitch is defined as a counterclockwise rotation about

24
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,905
the positive y-axis and yaw as a counterclockwise rotation about the positive z-axis,

25
00:01:16,905 --> 00:01:19,769
keeping in mind that the z-axis points down.

26
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:23,099
Notice that the body frame resembles our ECEF local frame,

27
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:24,599
where x points north,

28
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:27,584
y to the east, and z down. And that's no mistake.

29
00:01:27,584 --> 00:01:31,119
With this choice of body frame when the vehicle is level and pointing north,

30
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,320
the axes of the body frame are aligned with the local north, east,

31
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:39,114
down ECEF frame and yaw angles correspond to heading angles on a compass.

32
00:01:39,114 --> 00:01:43,449
This convention derives from way back when ships were first sailing on the oceans.

33
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,359
We didn't have to do things this way,

34
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,659
but generally it makes things more intuitive and these are

35
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:53,884
the most common choice of local and body-frame coordinate systems for aeronautics.

36
00:01:53,885 --> 00:01:57,225
There is no common standard for the orders specifying Euler angles.

37
00:01:57,224 --> 00:01:59,429
Whether it's roll first then pitch then yaw,

38
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,490
or pitch then yaw then roll.

39
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:03,479
You just have to agree on the ordering with

40
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,685
everybody you're developing your software with.

41
00:02:05,685 --> 00:02:09,884
And stick to it, because when I give you a triplet of numbers,

42
00:02:09,884 --> 00:02:14,484
it doesn't uniquely specify the orientation unless you already know the order of things.

43
00:02:14,485 --> 00:02:17,150
This is actually a source of many real world bugs in robotics,

44
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,604
so watch out for this.

45
00:02:18,604 --> 00:02:21,585
In this program, we'll go with a convention of roll first,

46
00:02:21,585 --> 00:02:24,200
then pitch, then yaw, in that order.

47
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:26,444
Euler angles are easy to understand,

48
00:02:26,444 --> 00:02:27,870
but they have some problems.

49
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,990
One of which is, as I just said,

50
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:33,064
that the order which the rotations are applied matters.

51
00:02:33,064 --> 00:02:35,099
So, if I'm going to say that the vehicle is

52
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,335
rolled and pitched to get some new orientation,

53
00:02:37,335 --> 00:02:39,780
I need to know whether the roll is applied first,

54
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,310
and then the pitch, or the other way around.

55
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,520
Again, it's a matter of convention.

56
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,695
But, if you get the convention wrong,

57
00:02:46,694 --> 00:02:49,454
then the orientation you calculate will also be wrong.

58
00:02:49,455 --> 00:02:52,650
But that's not all. There's also the problem of gimbal lock,

59
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,090
which is what we'll look at next.
