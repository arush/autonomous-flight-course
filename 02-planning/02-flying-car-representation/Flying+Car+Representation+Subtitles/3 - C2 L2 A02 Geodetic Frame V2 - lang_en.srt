00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,285
In our investigation of the planning problems so far,

2
00:00:03,285 --> 00:00:05,519
we've talked about the fact that different choices of

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,309
representation can make the problem easier or harder to solve.

4
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:12,885
In this context, one of the most basic questions to consider is,

5
00:00:12,884 --> 00:00:14,625
how do you represent the vehicle?

6
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:18,780
The way that you represent location in the world is typically using a coordinate frame.

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,850
For flying cars, we're actually going to have

8
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,515
to keep track of a few different coordinate frames.

9
00:00:23,515 --> 00:00:25,199
The first frame you're going to have to keep track

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,390
of is the one that you're probably most familiar

11
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,460
with which is latitude and longitude for specifying a location on the earth.

12
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,785
This will be a lot easier to explain if I actually had a globe

13
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:38,029
to show you. Thanks, globe fairy.

14
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:40,605
Latitude and longitude on the globe,

15
00:00:40,604 --> 00:00:43,504
they define what's known as the geodetic frame.

16
00:00:43,505 --> 00:00:45,500
Of course, for flying cars,

17
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,710
we need to keep track of altitude as well.

18
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,140
The geodetic frame is just a spherical coordinate system where

19
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,774
the typical coordinates are theta and phi are represented by altitude,

20
00:00:55,774 --> 00:00:58,159
longitude, and latitude respectively.

21
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,019
Altitude, of course, is your height above the earth's surface.

22
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,540
And so unlike a typical spherical coordinate system with r equals to zero at the origin,

23
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,690
we set altitude to be zero at the surface of the earth.

24
00:01:08,689 --> 00:01:11,840
Latitude and longitude then specify

25
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,049
your position on that spherical surface and they can be given in degrees,

26
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:16,929
minutes, seconds, or degrees decimals.

27
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,130
So, its important to know the units you're working with.

28
00:01:19,129 --> 00:01:23,030
It's also important to know the order in which you're being given latitude and longitude.

29
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,420
A spherical coordinate system can be a little bit difficult for actually doing

30
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,484
motion planning because it's hard to compute distances using angular quantities.

31
00:01:30,484 --> 00:01:33,170
So next, we'll convert to a more convenient local frame.
