00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,974
Now, let's take a closer look at the mathematical gimbal lock property of Euler angles.

2
00:00:04,974 --> 00:00:06,269
Given a coordinate system,

3
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:10,859
I can represent the orientation of some point in space by an actual rotation matrix.

4
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:14,714
So, I have my vehicle which is at some location in a particular frame,

5
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:16,905
let's say it's the local ECF frame,

6
00:00:16,905 --> 00:00:19,740
and I can represent the orientation of the vehicle as

7
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:24,070
corresponding to a rotation in that frame driven by rotation matrix.

8
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,429
Here are the three different rotation matrices

9
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:29,554
corresponding to a roll rotation about the x-axis,

10
00:00:29,554 --> 00:00:31,920
a pitch rotation about the y-axis,

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,200
and yaw rotation about the z-axis.

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,090
With these matrices, I can represent any attitude of the vehicle as a sequence of roll,

13
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,045
pitch, and yaw rotations.

14
00:00:41,045 --> 00:00:43,675
And to move the vehicle to a new orientation,

15
00:00:43,674 --> 00:00:47,634
I then multiply these matrices together to get my new representation.

16
00:00:47,634 --> 00:00:51,250
The order in which I apply these rotations matters, as we said a few times.

17
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,000
Then under certain conditions, I'll run into gimbal lock.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,920
But another concern is that this is now

19
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,140
an over parameterized system ready to

20
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,215
carry around nine numbers in order to represent my orientation,

21
00:01:01,215 --> 00:01:04,954
which does have some modest storage implications.

22
00:01:04,954 --> 00:01:07,469
Despite these drawbacks, Euler angles are still used in

23
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:11,400
many aeronautics applications because they are intuitive and useful,

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,690
for example, in communication with a human pilot.

25
00:01:14,689 --> 00:01:17,280
In this program, to run your calculations,

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,920
you'll be converting your Euler angles into quaternions,

27
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,305
which are a much more elegant representation

28
00:01:22,305 --> 00:01:25,000
that will simplify your life and your computation.
