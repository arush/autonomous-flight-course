1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,365
At this point, you may have noticed that your steer function is really rather naive,

2
00:00:04,365 --> 00:00:06,255
just randomly sampling controls,

3
00:00:06,255 --> 00:00:08,670
and then this has a significant impact on how

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,840
well your tree makes progress from the start to the goal.

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,940
Again, in general, solving for the controls that will allow

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,240
you to find an edge between any pair of states is a hard problem.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,920
But for this specific dynamics model,

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,230
it turns out you can be a fair bit smarter about

9
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,155
how you choose controls to get from X1 to X2.

10
00:00:25,155 --> 00:00:28,410
You can use geometry to see if the sample point X2 is within

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,445
the reachable half circle from the nearest point in the current tree, X_near.

12
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:34,920
You can solve for these three angles exactly.

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,660
This is not quite a half circle,

14
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,060
but all of the points in this area form the set of

15
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,595
feasible points reachable by the Dubin's car model,

16
00:00:41,595 --> 00:00:45,105
with our max horizon t as a function of the maximum velocity,

17
00:00:45,105 --> 00:00:48,990
and the horizon t. Any point that lies inside this region here,

18
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,510
is reachable with a single setting of controls.

19
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,205
And we can solve for those.

20
00:00:53,205 --> 00:00:55,850
If X2 is not in the reachable half circle,

21
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,395
we can choose the max.

22
00:00:57,395 --> 00:00:59,310
The point that's either going to lie on this side,

23
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,205
so that X2 lines up over here, or on this side.

24
00:01:02,205 --> 00:01:05,266
Then we want to set the steering angle in this direction,

25
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:06,713
so it lies over here,

26
00:01:06,713 --> 00:01:08,745
or set the steering angle in this direction,

27
00:01:08,745 --> 00:01:10,410
so we make progress towards here.

28
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,050
And we can actually modify our steer function to

29
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,540
return a maximum value for the steering angle,

30
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,320
to make progress towards this half plane or this half plane.

31
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,430
In the next exercise,

32
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,000
you'll implement this modification to your steer function.
