1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,685
The dynamics models that we've talked about so far

2
00:00:02,685 --> 00:00:05,495
have constraints that involve just the current state.

3
00:00:05,495 --> 00:00:07,860
But remember, we have an autopilot that

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,275
allows us to control the motion of the vehicle so it

5
00:00:10,275 --> 00:00:15,510
also makes sense to incorporate the control into the differential constraints as well.

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:18,030
Very common dynamics model is what's known as

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:21,930
the Dubin's car has a state X, Y, and theta.

8
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:24,315
And it has the following dynamics model which is that

9
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:27,865
X_dot is equal to the cosine of the current orientation,

10
00:00:27,865 --> 00:00:30,790
Y_dot is the sine of the current orientation.

11
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,700
And we also assume that we have the ability to

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,280
steer the vehicle so we have a steering angle.

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,190
U_phi, and we're going to use U in

14
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:41,415
general to denote controls that we're giving to the vehicle.

15
00:00:41,415 --> 00:00:47,138
So we say U_phi to specify that as the steering angle phi of the wheels.

16
00:00:47,138 --> 00:00:50,990
The change in orientation of the vehicle is the tangent of the steering angle.

17
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,513
And presumably, we also have a constraint on the control.

18
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:56,550
Let's say the steering angle is limited to be

19
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,770
in the range minus pi over two to pi over two.

20
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,340
So, minus 90 to 90 degrees.

21
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,660
Implicit in this is an assumption that the vehicle is moving at

22
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,130
a fixed velocity of one meter per second in a forward direction.

23
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,610
This dynamics model is what's called the Dubin's car and there are different variants of

24
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:18,220
the model that allow the forward velocity to vary or allow backwards motion as well.

25
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:21,605
The Dubin's car is particularly relevant in the flying car domain,

26
00:01:21,605 --> 00:01:24,870
because it's a pretty good model for fixed wing aircraft.

27
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,480
There's an easy way to convert the steering angle in the model into

28
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,510
a flight path angle and bank angle commands that you

29
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,698
would normally give to a fixed wing autopilot.

30
00:01:34,698 --> 00:01:36,735
For our purposes in the upcoming project,

31
00:01:36,735 --> 00:01:40,000
the Dubin's car model is not a particularly great representation of

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,560
true quadrotor dynamics to exactly follow a curve trajectory.

33
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,059
The autopilot for quadrotor,

34
00:01:46,059 --> 00:01:47,490
unlike a fixed wing aircraft,

35
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,297
would have to constantly adjust the thrust vector through the curve.

36
00:01:51,297 --> 00:01:52,570
Unlike a fixed wing vehicle,

37
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:55,750
there isn't a single setting of the controls that will make

38
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:00,610
the quadrotor follow a curved path described by a specific steering angle.

39
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,570
That being said, unless the quadrotor stops at each waypoint,

40
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,386
the inertia of the vehicle is going to cause it to follow

41
00:02:07,386 --> 00:02:12,220
some curved path as it changes direction and moves through a waypoint.

42
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:14,423
If the plan looks like this,

43
00:02:14,423 --> 00:02:17,260
the quadrotor is not actually going to follow this exact trajectory,

44
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,530
unless it stops at that waypoint.

45
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:22,360
As the vehicle adjusts the thrust of individual motors in

46
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,730
order to change the thrust vector from heading in this direction,

47
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,005
to heading in this direction,

48
00:02:28,005 --> 00:02:30,400
what's actually going to happen is that

49
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,135
the quadrotor is going to either follow a curved path,

50
00:02:34,135 --> 00:02:37,000
it looks like that, or maybe it starts adjusting it's heading

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,585
direction earlier and it will follow a curve path that looks more like that.

52
00:02:40,585 --> 00:02:42,820
This is just a function of the inertia.

53
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,230
While the Dubin's car model isn't really the ideal model for quadrotor motion,

54
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,375
physics tells us that a vehicle with inertia

55
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:52,425
is going to follow a curve path of some form.

56
00:02:52,425 --> 00:02:56,530
Let's just assume for now that our quadrotor autopilot gives us the ability to follow

57
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,770
a specific curve path and thus the Dubin's car model

58
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:03,250
can serve as a reasonable vehicle model that we can incorporate into our plan.
