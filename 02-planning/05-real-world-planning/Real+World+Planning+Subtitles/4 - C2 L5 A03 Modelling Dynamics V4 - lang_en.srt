1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860
In solving the planning problem,

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,645
we've ignored the mass of the vehicle,

3
00:00:03,645 --> 00:00:05,745
and force is acting on it like gravity.

4
00:00:05,745 --> 00:00:08,414
But when you include forces and mass in your planning problem,

5
00:00:08,414 --> 00:00:10,349
even when there aren't a lot of obstacles

6
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,035
around with complicated passages to fly through,

7
00:00:13,035 --> 00:00:16,859
you still need to think about issues like planning to fly slowly enough,

8
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,195
that you have sufficient room to stop when you get close to an obstacle or waypoint.

9
00:00:21,195 --> 00:00:25,289
Remember, that the attitude of the vehicle directs the thrust vector.

10
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:27,689
And so, you have to think about how quickly you can rotate

11
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:30,545
the vehicle to accelerate or decelerate.

12
00:00:30,545 --> 00:00:33,340
The constraints on a vehicle's motion that result from

13
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:37,240
the vehicle's mass and forces acting on it are known as dynamic constraints.

14
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,980
And dynamic constraints generally,

15
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:41,515
show up as a form of differential constraint.

16
00:00:41,515 --> 00:00:45,895
While there may be other differential constraints related to how the vehicle moves,

17
00:00:45,895 --> 00:00:49,765
like the steering mechanism on a car for example, in this lesson,

18
00:00:49,765 --> 00:00:51,759
we're going to look at how to find plans for

19
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:54,839
vehicles that have differential constraints of all kinds.

20
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,175
The first thing you need to work out is how to specify differential constraints.

21
00:00:59,174 --> 00:01:00,899
In some cases, it's easy.

22
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,449
For example, imagine a vehicle flying in

23
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,480
a strong prevailing wind blowing in the positive x direction.

24
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,230
If your constraint is that you must be able to tolerate any crosswind velocity,

25
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,730
but you can never fly upwind,

26
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:15,840
then this constraint can be written as a derivative on x is greater than zero.

27
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,820
Now, for a flying car,

28
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:20,084
you might also have acceleration constraints,

29
00:01:20,084 --> 00:01:24,164
which are constraints on how quickly you can accelerate or decelerate.

30
00:01:24,165 --> 00:01:28,895
Acceleration constraints are a function of the second derivative of the state.

31
00:01:28,894 --> 00:01:33,354
A common form of differential constraint is what's called the vehicle model.

32
00:01:33,355 --> 00:01:36,085
The vehicle model addresses questions like,

33
00:01:36,084 --> 00:01:39,625
"What motion is the vehicle capable of given its current state?

34
00:01:39,625 --> 00:01:41,680
How do you specify the possible trajectories

35
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,095
the vehicle can take from its current state?"

36
00:01:44,094 --> 00:01:48,310
This is usually written as a differential equation or set of equations.

37
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:51,340
For instance, suppose you have a vehicle that is

38
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:55,195
constrained to fly in a counterclockwise motion in a circle.

39
00:01:55,194 --> 00:02:00,369
We can write a model for this as x-dot is equal to minus y and y-dot is equal to x.

40
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,710
In this case, the vehicle is constrained to fly in

41
00:02:02,709 --> 00:02:05,144
a circle of unit radius centered at the origin.

42
00:02:05,144 --> 00:02:09,004
This model says that the vehicle motion has to always be tangent to the circle.

43
00:02:09,004 --> 00:02:14,074
These sorts of equations are often how we specify how a flight vehicle is able to move.

44
00:02:14,074 --> 00:02:18,259
A challenge with specifying the motion of the vehicle this way is that you can no

45
00:02:18,259 --> 00:02:20,149
longer do simple line drawing to check

46
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,909
whether a path between two states is in free space.

47
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:27,770
You have to integrate the model forward to know what the path is going to look like.

48
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:29,784
Integration can be complicated,

49
00:02:29,784 --> 00:02:32,990
especially for nonlinear dynamics models like this.

50
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,550
If you're lucky, you can solve

51
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,745
the differential equations explicitly for the state at any time t,

52
00:02:37,745 --> 00:02:40,980
but if not, you have to use a numerical integration scheme.

53
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:44,935
The simplest integration scheme is to assume a linear approximation,

54
00:02:44,935 --> 00:02:48,640
so that you can write this dynamics model as a set of difference equations,

55
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,929
such as xt plus one is equal to xt plus yt, delta-t.

56
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,465
In this case, you have to pick some value of delta-t.

57
00:02:55,465 --> 00:02:57,594
The larger the value you pick for delta-t,

58
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:01,164
the worse your linear approximation is going to be for nonlinear systems.

59
00:03:01,164 --> 00:03:04,164
So, for this model constraining the vehicle to fly in a circle,

60
00:03:04,164 --> 00:03:08,829
the linear approximation would look like a series of straight line segments like this.

61
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:12,520
Similarly, yt is equal to yt plus xt

62
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,855
times delta-t. Small values of delta-t are going to be a better approximation again,

63
00:03:16,854 --> 00:03:18,699
but more computationally demanding.

64
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,129
Large values of delta-t are easier to simulate,

65
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:22,734
but a worse approximation.

66
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:24,655
To apply this approximation,

67
00:03:24,655 --> 00:03:28,284
you would need to iterate on xt and yt from say,

68
00:03:28,284 --> 00:03:30,460
zero to some point in the future.

69
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,310
In the next exercise, you'll get a chance to implement

70
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,659
an integration scheme for a dynamics model using the linear approximation.
