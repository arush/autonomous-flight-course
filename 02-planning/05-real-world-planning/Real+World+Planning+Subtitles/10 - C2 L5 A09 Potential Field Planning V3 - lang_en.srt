1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,950
In most of our planning so far,

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,480
we have assumed that the map is

3
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,510
a perfect model of the environment the vehicle is flying in.

4
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,790
But of course, we said a few times that that is

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,120
a risky assumption not suitable for real-world applications.

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,120
The obstacles in the environment can change for any number of reasons.

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,825
Buildings get put up or taken down all the time,

8
00:00:17,825 --> 00:00:21,405
trees grow, there may be things moving around like other flying cars.

9
00:00:21,405 --> 00:00:24,210
Assuming that you have some sensor onboard to

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,150
measure the position of obstacles in the local 3D environment,

11
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:28,695
this could be a lidar,

12
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,540
or depth camera for example,

13
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,720
one thing you could do is continually update

14
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,890
the local map in your receding horizon planner and replan with each update.

15
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,605
But replaning can take some time,

16
00:00:40,605 --> 00:00:43,440
and full replanning may not always be necessary.

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,123
Nearly always, even with unexpected obstacles,

18
00:00:47,123 --> 00:00:49,500
the original plan is close to correct.

19
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,660
The appearance of an unexpected obstacle may

20
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,285
require just a local perturbation to the original plan,

21
00:00:54,285 --> 00:00:57,105
to dodge around the unexpected tree or flying car.

22
00:00:57,105 --> 00:00:59,820
There is an efficient way to think about obstacles,

23
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,370
that makes it easy to dodge around them without having to

24
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,145
incur the full cost of replanning.

25
00:01:05,145 --> 00:01:08,540
Let's assume, we have our original plan as a set of waypoints.

26
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,750
You can then think of the next waypoint as

27
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,110
the potential field exerting an attractive force on the vehicle,

28
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,840
essentially pulling the vehicle downhill toward it.

29
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:20,605
Let's set that potential to be a quadratic function of the distance to the goal,

30
00:01:20,605 --> 00:01:23,110
so that the attractive potential is some factor

31
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:26,854
alpha times one half times the distance to the goal squared.

32
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:29,920
That defines a quadratic potential surface like the one shown here.

33
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,220
And whenever we think about moving around in a potential,

34
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,515
what that potential does is exert a force which is the derivative of the potential.

35
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:40,180
Which in this case, is the derivative of alpha times one half,

36
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,980
times the distance squared,

37
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:45,210
or simply alpha times the distance to the goal.

38
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,880
The alpha term is just some constant we can choose to

39
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,050
control how strong the pull of the goal is.

40
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,890
We can also think of each obstacle point as

41
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,080
exerting a repulsive force in the flight vehicle,

42
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,750
pushing the vehicle away from the obstacle.

43
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,495
In order to make this a repulsive potential,

44
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:03,960
we'll have it depend on the inverse of the distance to the obstacle,

45
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,060
and we'll define a distance Q_max beyond which will set the obstacle potential to zero.

46
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,925
Meaning that if you steer well clear of obstacles,

47
00:02:11,925 --> 00:02:13,500
you don't feel the potential.

48
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,820
Again, the force exerted by obstacles is just the derivative of the potential,

49
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,560
and now beta is a constant you can use to set the strength of the obstacle potential.

50
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,190
If you now add up the attractive and repulsive forces,

51
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,620
you get a net force vector that always

52
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,905
pushes the vehicle towards the goal and away from obstacles.

53
00:02:31,905 --> 00:02:35,310
Remember, this isn't a true force like wind or gravity.

54
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,390
But if you tell the autopilot to steer toward the direction of this force vector,

55
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:43,485
the vehicle will make progress toward the goal while dodging obstacles.

56
00:02:43,485 --> 00:02:46,155
If you think of the vehicles eventual path

57
00:02:46,155 --> 00:02:48,570
as the integral of the forces at each time instant,

58
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:52,260
then you'll recognize that the forces are a source of potential energy and,

59
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,245
this technique is known as potential field motion planning.

60
00:02:55,245 --> 00:02:57,220
It's a really old idea,

61
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,590
but was originally invented for cruise missiles traveling at high speed

62
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:04,406
that needed to plan motions to avoid obstacles very quickly.

63
00:03:04,406 --> 00:03:07,340
It's a great way for any fast-moving flight vehicle to

64
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:11,285
efficiently plan to dodge obstacles. There is one wrinkle.

65
00:03:11,285 --> 00:03:13,490
Like any energy potential field,

66
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:16,085
the motion planning potential field can have local minimum.

67
00:03:16,085 --> 00:03:19,535
Places, where the notional force vectors all cancel each other out,

68
00:03:19,535 --> 00:03:21,410
leaving the vehicle motionless.

69
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:26,120
In these cases, there's nothing the vehicle can do except stop forward motion,

70
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,610
and do a full replan. So part of

71
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:32,190
potential field planning is being careful to check for local minimum.

72
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,820
In the next exercise,

73
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,040
you'll get a chance to try this out for yourself,

74
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,070
when you implement your own potential field motion planner.
