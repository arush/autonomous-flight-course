1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,430
Restrictions on the states that a vehicle can

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,235
physically be in are called kinematic constraints.

3
00:00:05,235 --> 00:00:09,900
In other words, these are constraints on motion that aren't a result of force or mass.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,730
Kinematic constraints are generally,

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,610
a function of geometry and for flying cars,

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,715
they arise primarily as a result of the distribution of obstacles in the environment.

7
00:00:19,715 --> 00:00:23,010
You can think of the kinematic constraints as defining the boundary

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,055
between the feasible and infeasible parts of your configuration space.

9
00:00:27,055 --> 00:00:31,680
Any feasible motion plan must satisfy the kinematic constraints.

10
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,830
There are, however, other constraints on motion that can arise from

11
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,905
how a vehicle can move through space or what maneuvers it can perform.

12
00:00:38,905 --> 00:00:42,700
A quadrotor is a pretty amazing vehicle in that it can

13
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,705
more or less move in any direction, regardless of orientation.

14
00:00:46,705 --> 00:00:51,710
A car on the other hand does have a set of constraints on allowable motion.

15
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,235
Still ignoring properties such as mass or the forces acting on the vehicles,

16
00:00:55,235 --> 00:00:57,110
cars or at least most cars,

17
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,525
cannot move in arbitrary directions.

18
00:00:59,525 --> 00:01:02,420
Cars are restricted to forward and backwards motion along

19
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,455
a line or an arc defined by the steering angle of the wheels.

20
00:01:06,455 --> 00:01:09,155
The constraints induced by your car steering mechanism

21
00:01:09,155 --> 00:01:13,520
restrict the allowable changes to the state in configuration space.

22
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,990
So, for example, just because your car is sitting next to an open parking spot,

23
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,365
doesn't mean the parking problem is easy.

24
00:01:20,365 --> 00:01:22,655
If you don't consider restrictions on steering,

25
00:01:22,655 --> 00:01:25,985
then your motion planner might think that an action to the right like

26
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:30,665
this is perfectly feasible in terms of the kinematic constraints of the environment.

27
00:01:30,665 --> 00:01:32,330
But in this case,

28
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,790
it's the constraints on what your car can do in terms of

29
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,210
the allowable motion that makes this problem hard.

30
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:42,500
It's really about restrictions on how the vehicle is allowed to change its state.

31
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,080
These restrictions are called differential constraints,

32
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,015
and as the name suggests,

33
00:01:47,015 --> 00:01:49,915
these are constraints on the derivative of the state.

34
00:01:49,915 --> 00:01:53,960
So far, we have ignored differential constraints in our planning algorithms.

35
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,345
We assumed that as long as a straight line exists

36
00:01:56,345 --> 00:01:59,180
between two states through the free part of the configuration space,

37
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,500
that it's feasible to include a motion between those states as part of the plan.

38
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,895
It turns out that's actually a pretty reasonable assumption for a slow moving quadrotor.

39
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:12,455
A vehicle of no differential constraints of any kind is called a holonomic vehicle.

40
00:02:12,455 --> 00:02:14,375
The fact that all vehicles have mass,

41
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,670
implies that there is always a constraint on how

42
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,445
fast a vehicle can accelerate or decelerate.

43
00:02:19,445 --> 00:02:21,755
But for vehicles like quadrotors,

44
00:02:21,755 --> 00:02:24,870
we can often ignore these kinds of constraints.

45
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,390
Vehicles that seem to have

46
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,010
no different constraints like quadrotors are called quasi-holonomic.

47
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,640
And for these types of vehicles,

48
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,210
solving the planning problem is often quite easy.

49
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,220
But for vehicles that aren't Quasi-Holonomic,

50
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:41,125
you need to think about allowable motions as part of the planning problem.

51
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:44,110
When your quadrotor is moving at a significant velocity,

52
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,590
you can no longer treat it as a Quasi-Holonomic vehicle.

53
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:51,280
And next, we'll look at how to include its dynamics in your planning solution.
