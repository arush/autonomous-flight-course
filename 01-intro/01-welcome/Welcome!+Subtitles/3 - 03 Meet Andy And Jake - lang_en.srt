00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,330
Hello and welcome to the Flying Car Nanodegree Program.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,185
We'll get you coding up self-flying drones and flying car fleets in no time.

3
00:00:07,184 --> 00:00:11,445
But before diving in, we want to say hello and give a quick program overview.

4
00:00:11,445 --> 00:00:13,365
So, to start, hi.

5
00:00:13,365 --> 00:00:17,265
I'm Jake and I'm the product lead for the Flying Car Nanodegree Program.

6
00:00:17,265 --> 00:00:22,125
Before joining Udacity, I was a computer science PhD candidate at Stanford University,

7
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:25,230
where I specialized in AI, robotics, and perception.

8
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,500
As product lead, I make sure everything from classroom content,

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,030
to your career prospects,

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,039
to the curriculum are top notch.

11
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:33,359
And speaking of curriculum-

12
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,884
Hi. I'm Andy and I'm the program curriculum lead.

13
00:00:36,884 --> 00:00:38,609
I studied physics at MIT,

14
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:41,594
and I've been involved at Udacity since basically day one.

15
00:00:41,594 --> 00:00:43,439
I've worked on everything from psychology,

16
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:45,179
to physics, to self-driving cars.

17
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:47,460
And as curriculum lead for this program,

18
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,799
I work directly with our instructors to make sure

19
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,349
you get the best educational experience possible.

20
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,910
Great.

21
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:56,905
Now that you've met Sebastian, Andy, and myself,

22
00:00:56,905 --> 00:00:58,079
in the rest of this lesson,

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,412
you'll meet our other amazing instructors,

24
00:01:00,412 --> 00:01:01,979
learn about how the program works,

25
00:01:01,979 --> 00:01:03,644
and wrap up with a little fun.

26
00:01:03,645 --> 00:01:07,750
We're thrilled to be working with you and welcome to the program.
