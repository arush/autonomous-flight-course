1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,865
It is my really great pleasure to introduce the three instructors in this course.

2
00:00:05,865 --> 00:00:08,985
Angela, from Germany originally but at Toronto now.

3
00:00:08,985 --> 00:00:13,890
Angela heads the Dynamic Systems Lab at the Institute for Aerospace Studies at

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,350
the University of Toronto and she's also

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:20,130
the Associate Director of the Center for Aerobotics Research and Education.

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,650
I had to cheat because the title is longer than

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,860
any other title I've seen in my life. So, what does it mean? What do you do?

8
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:31,125
So, I'm leading a team conducting research at the interface of robotics,

9
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,805
controls, and machine learning.

10
00:00:32,805 --> 00:00:34,455
And what this means is,

11
00:00:34,455 --> 00:00:39,345
we built robotic systems that can learn from experience and from each other,

12
00:00:39,345 --> 00:00:41,850
and the goal is that they, through that,

13
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,485
can do tasks better,

14
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:46,980
operate more safely and are generally more independent.

15
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,475
That's exciting because even if you got 10,000 Amazon drones in the sky,

16
00:00:50,475 --> 00:00:52,680
if this one learn something about the world,

17
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,710
all the 9,999 others will learn the same thing.

18
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,840
That would be one of the ideas.

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,300
That's great. Nick, Nick Roy,

20
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,010
we've known each other for a long time because we've

21
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,750
worked together at Carnegie Mellon University

22
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,710
but he's now Professor of Aeronautics and Astronauts at MIT,

23
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,110
and he leads a group of researchers in CSAIL,

24
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,360
MIT's Artificial Intelligence Lab. What do you do?

25
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,870
Well, to first-order, I'm

26
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,640
very lucky to have a great group of students and

27
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,415
post-docs and I do PR and fundraising for them.

28
00:01:20,415 --> 00:01:24,100
But more specifically, what we do is

29
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,265
we look at a lot of related issues to what Angela was mentioning.

30
00:01:27,265 --> 00:01:30,940
Issues of vehicles, how they navigate in complicated,

31
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,630
cluttered environments where you don't have external infrastructure like GPS, et cetera.

32
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,240
We look at the issues of how these vehicles understand what's

33
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,195
happening around them especially in a human-centered environment.

34
00:01:40,195 --> 00:01:43,060
They need to be able to interpret what's happening around them,

35
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,365
understand what people want,

36
00:01:44,365 --> 00:01:46,780
and make safe and reliable decisions.

37
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,900
Now, together, we're building the Nanodegree program on

38
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,410
flying cars and flying cars is a bit of a misnomer.

39
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,060
It's not going to look like cars with bumpers,

40
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,820
but the field of flying

41
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,265
vehicles is becoming incredibly hot in Silicon Valley and around the world,

42
00:02:01,265 --> 00:02:03,890
and I'm super delighted we could attract

43
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:08,360
two super stellar professors to teach this business program with us.

44
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,630
So, we came here together because we are building this joint Nanodegree,

45
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:16,520
it's the world's first educational program on flying cars and hopefully,

46
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,260
in a good Udacity fashion,

47
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,580
we will teach more students

48
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,860
these technologies and all universities in the world combined.

49
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,270
Let's find out. But I wanted to ask both of you a bit

50
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,850
about what you're actually teaching and about the interesting problems

51
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,550
are for students. Maybe start with Nick?

52
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,536
Okay.

53
00:02:32,536 --> 00:02:36,705
So for me, the flying car is a great aspirational goal.

54
00:02:36,705 --> 00:02:38,205
We've got a long way to go.

55
00:02:38,205 --> 00:02:41,790
The real content that I want students

56
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,975
to get from this is addressing the challenges of making these vehicles smarter.

57
00:02:45,975 --> 00:02:49,500
So, one of the dirty little secrets of any unmanned system,

58
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,580
whether it's on air, on the ground,

59
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,720
is the total labor,

60
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,135
human labor required to operate that unmanned system.

61
00:02:54,135 --> 00:02:56,385
These vehicles are fundamentally really dumb.

62
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,140
All they do is get from point A to point B.

63
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,320
They can't react to the unexpected and in the ways that people can.

64
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,915
They can't adjust what they're doing.

65
00:03:03,915 --> 00:03:05,310
That kind of intelligence,

66
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,780
that kind of reasoning, that kind of autonomy,

67
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,620
is core to what we're trying to teach for enabling flying cars.

68
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,670
Great.

69
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:16,110
So, what I'm really excited about in this Nanodegree is that we really teach

70
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,570
the fundamentals on how the physics of

71
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,435
these vehicles were both fixed-wing and multi-rotor.

72
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:24,855
But then, take it all the way to a real implementation

73
00:03:24,855 --> 00:03:28,980
either in a high-fidelity simulator or the real drone itself.

74
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:34,410
And I think, both skills really are needed to bring the field forward in the future.

75
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:40,185
And I'm so excited that both of you are such great instructors in our Nanodegree program.

76
00:03:40,185 --> 00:03:41,475
And for you who are watching,

77
00:03:41,475 --> 00:03:43,710
if you're interested in becoming a student, enroll or apply,

78
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:47,500
and I guess, I'll see you in class.
