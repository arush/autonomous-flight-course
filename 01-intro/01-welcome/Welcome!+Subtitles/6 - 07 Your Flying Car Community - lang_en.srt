00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
When you enroll in Udacity Nanodegree Program,

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,099
you become part of a global community.

3
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:07,134
You can connect instantly with thousands of

4
00:00:07,134 --> 00:00:09,759
amazing people in our Flying Car Slack Community.

5
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:12,108
So, be sure to keep in touch on Slack and you never know,

6
00:00:12,108 --> 00:00:15,880
you might even find a study group to collaborate with in your hometown.

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,880
And in addition to that student community,

8
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:21,689
Udacity has dedicated resources set up for you to succeed.

9
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:24,045
For one, whenever you submit your projects,

10
00:00:24,045 --> 00:00:27,640
they will be reviewed by real human experts not just some bots.

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,089
And whenever you have additional flying car questions,

12
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:31,629
well, we have a team for that too.

13
00:00:31,629 --> 00:00:34,905
Hi, I'm Tucker, I'm Aurina, and I'm Lisbeth.

14
00:00:34,905 --> 00:00:36,664
And we're the student experience team.

15
00:00:36,664 --> 00:00:40,379
We'll always be monitoring Slack and ready to answer any questions you have.

16
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,760

17
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,244

18
00:00:46,244 --> 00:00:49,214
to meet-ups, to careers, and beyond.

00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:53,000
So on behalf of all of us, welcome to Udacity.
