1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:04,054
I am firmly convinced,

2
00:00:04,054 --> 00:00:05,493
that in the future,

3
00:00:05,495 --> 00:00:09,504
the majority of urban transportation will take place in the air.

4
00:00:09,505 --> 00:00:12,845
It's something that, we a society,

5
00:00:12,845 --> 00:00:15,245
have wanted for over 100 years.

6
00:00:15,243 --> 00:00:18,934
Little kids grow up drawing pictures of flying cars,

7
00:00:18,934 --> 00:00:21,859
building them out of lego, and dream of having their own one day.

8
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:25,225
We called it flying cars because it's our aspiration,

9
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:27,037
we really want to change the world with flight.

10
00:00:27,036 --> 00:00:28,820
It might start with the Amazon and Google

11
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,699
package delivery but it's going to go to people.

12
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:34,939
We're already seeing it happen with self driving cars.

13
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:38,359
We've already seen it happen with little drones.

14
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:43,185
These different kinds of technologies are enabling new kinds of transportation.

15
00:00:43,185 --> 00:00:46,789
We are going to cover drone technology with variety levels.

16
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:49,009
We're going to spend some time talking obviously

17
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:52,219
about the higher level autonomy and the mission planning.

18
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:53,899
Really what this course is about,

19
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:57,429
is giving students the chance to implement algorithms

20
00:00:57,429 --> 00:01:01,240
and ideas and technical concepts on aircrafts.

21
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:04,484
What we want to do is we're going to try and make that future happen sooner by

22
00:01:04,483 --> 00:01:08,233
training future engineers in the technologies needed to make that vision happen.

23
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:10,669
Udacity is a great starting point for

24
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,855
anybody who wants to learn more about these technologies,

25
00:01:12,855 --> 00:01:14,570
more about this application domain,

26
00:01:14,569 --> 00:01:17,183
and more about flying vehicles.

27
00:01:17,185 --> 00:01:19,295
This is something that no one talks about.

28
00:01:19,295 --> 00:01:21,150
But I promise, in a few years time,

29
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:23,005
it'll be the hottest topic on the planet.

30
00:01:23,004 --> 00:01:25,549
So, come to the skies with us by

31
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:29,759
applying this world's first flying car nanodegree program.
