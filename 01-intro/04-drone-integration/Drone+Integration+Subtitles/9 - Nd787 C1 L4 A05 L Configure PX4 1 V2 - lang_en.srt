1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,330
So let's head back to that settings tab and let's make sure

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,974
that we've got our autopilot configured in the way we want.

3
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:11,114
First thing down this list of interests is the sensors tab.

4
00:00:11,115 --> 00:00:13,095
Just say okay to that.

5
00:00:13,095 --> 00:00:17,774
In the sensors, it's going to tell you the state of calibration for our compass,

6
00:00:17,774 --> 00:00:19,529
or gyro, the accelerometers,

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,780
what we define as level,

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,630
and here you'll see you've got green dots down the line

9
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:27,869
which means everything has been calibrated and taken care of.

10
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:30,160
However, as I mentioned,

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,884
if you just installed the autopilot,

12
00:00:32,884 --> 00:00:35,134
these may have some red dots appear.

13
00:00:35,134 --> 00:00:36,524
And in those cases,

14
00:00:36,524 --> 00:00:40,325
what you'll need to do is click the appropriate sensor,

15
00:00:40,325 --> 00:00:42,410
and walk through the configuration.

16
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:43,879
In this window here,

17
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,108
it'll show you the steps you need to take,

18
00:00:46,107 --> 00:00:48,844
and it will walk you through the calibration process.

19
00:00:48,844 --> 00:00:50,960
So the next one down the line is radio.

20
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,420
And the intel arrow should already come configured with the radio calibrations,

21
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:00,185
but in case it isn't or if you have your own drone,

22
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,638
you'll want to go ahead and make sure you calibrate the radio,

23
00:01:02,637 --> 00:01:05,855
and once again it will walk you through that calibration process.

24
00:01:05,855 --> 00:01:09,020
We're taking a quick stop through this page though because it's

25
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:12,724
a great way to monitor and look to make sure that everything's working.

26
00:01:12,724 --> 00:01:18,515
So, for example as I move the throttle we'll see that throttle dot increase and decrease,

27
00:01:18,515 --> 00:01:21,769
and the same for roll, pitch, and yaw.

28
00:01:21,769 --> 00:01:26,569
Why we stopped here is before we go on to configuring our flight modes,

29
00:01:26,569 --> 00:01:29,414
we want to know what switches we have access to.

30
00:01:29,415 --> 00:01:33,355
And you may not know exactly how the radio is configured so that we can do is we can

31
00:01:33,355 --> 00:01:37,060
go through and toggle some of the different switches on our radio.

32
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,234
For example, as I toggle this one,

33
00:01:39,234 --> 00:01:43,539
we notice that channel five moves.

34
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,420
And we get actually an urgent notification,

35
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,640
which we'll ignore for the moment.

36
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,465
And as I change this switch,

37
00:01:51,465 --> 00:01:53,879
I've got channel seven.

38
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,329
As I move the other switches,

39
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:58,569
I don't see other channels go so that tells me I have channels

40
00:01:58,569 --> 00:02:03,654
five and seven have switches that will allow me to configure my flight modes,

41
00:02:03,655 --> 00:02:06,724
which we'll go ahead and do now.

42
00:02:06,724 --> 00:02:10,935
So, most likely when you came to the flight modes tab,

43
00:02:10,935 --> 00:02:12,884
you were visited with a screen like this.

44
00:02:12,884 --> 00:02:17,069
And it allows you to assign different flight modes to those three positions.

45
00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:22,544
However it's a little bit limited because it only allows us to choose three options.

46
00:02:22,544 --> 00:02:27,030
So what we're gonna do is use this multi-channel mode selection.

47
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,520
This allows us to couple switches on

48
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,550
channel five and seven to give us a wider range of flight mode options.

49
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:38,735
So we're gonna go ahead and do that and you'll see in the position I have it here,

50
00:02:38,735 --> 00:02:40,655
it says it's stabilized main.

51
00:02:40,655 --> 00:02:43,039
So now what happens is that channel five

52
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:45,590
switch which is a three positions which allows us

53
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:50,650
to choose between main, assisted, and mission.

54
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,039
We won't be using mission,

55
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:55,250
this is the PX4 mode that allows you to

56
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,050
execute those missions that you can configure up in this A to B tab.

57
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:05,885
Assist now defaults to using channel seven that second switch,

58
00:03:05,884 --> 00:03:11,754
to be able to configure a second kind of set of flight modes.

59
00:03:11,754 --> 00:03:14,349
So in this case, we can be in

60
00:03:14,349 --> 00:03:17,949
an assisted mode in either altitude hold or position control.

61
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:19,569
And that's the way I have it configured.

62
00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:24,174
I've changed, you can slide these for changing the thresholds.

63
00:03:24,175 --> 00:03:27,340
So I can toggle between altitude and position control now,

64
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,564
and then finally I've set the last position in the switch

65
00:03:30,564 --> 00:03:35,620
to be, I set it to channel seven to be off board control.

66
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,200
And you'll keep seeing as we get these notifications

67
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:41,424
reject position control or reject off-board control.

68
00:03:41,425 --> 00:03:43,795
We can go ahead and take a look at those.

69
00:03:43,794 --> 00:03:47,959
The reason those are being rejected right now is that we don't have GPS.

70
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,305
In order to be in either position control or off-board,

71
00:03:51,305 --> 00:03:56,120
the autopilot is using GPS in the loop to make decisions.

72
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,275
So, it won't allow you to be in those modes if you don't have GPS.

73
00:04:00,275 --> 00:04:02,569
Altitude hold actually just uses

74
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:06,349
the barometer on-board so it doesn't need GPS in order to work,

75
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:09,259
which is why it allows us to go into altitude hold.

76
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:12,289
Well let's bring it back into manual and I don't know if you've

77
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:15,215
noticed up here as I switch through these,

78
00:04:15,215 --> 00:04:18,709
the mode is displayed appropriately at the top.

79
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:22,214
So now we have our switches configured,

80
00:04:22,214 --> 00:04:25,169
and that allows us to switch through the different flight modes which will

81
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:28,935
be tremendously helpful when we go outside and actually fly.

82
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:32,925
The next one that we're going to look at is power.

83
00:04:32,925 --> 00:04:36,424
And this is just to make sure that if you're flying a three-cell battery,

84
00:04:36,423 --> 00:04:39,890
you've properly marked up three-cells or if you're flying a four-cell battery,

85
00:04:39,891 --> 00:04:41,760
you've made that four-cells.

86
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,389
This just makes it possible for

87
00:04:45,389 --> 00:04:50,414
the battery status to display correct information about the percentage.

88
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,814
If you have the wrong configuration here,

89
00:04:52,814 --> 00:04:58,115
it may overestimate or underestimate the amount of flight time that you have remaining.

90
00:04:58,115 --> 00:05:02,139
Finally, we're going to make a couple optional changes.

91
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:04,300
We're going to go down to this parameters tab.

92
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:10,915
And this lists all the different possible parameters for the PX4 autopilot.

93
00:05:10,915 --> 00:05:13,420
I'll leave it to you to kind of flip through

94
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,210
and get an idea of what different options there are,

95
00:05:16,209 --> 00:05:18,189
but what we're going to go through is we're going to go

96
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:20,800
into this multicopter position control.

97
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,650
These are the parameters that dictate the behavior of

98
00:05:23,649 --> 00:05:27,939
our drone when it's under position control or autonomous control.

99
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:30,879
So really this is a lot of dictation of

100
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,295
the behavior that will happen when your script is running.

101
00:05:34,295 --> 00:05:38,025
I'm going to make two changes in this file,

102
00:05:38,024 --> 00:05:42,914
purely for point of view safety and just to slow things down a little bit.

103
00:05:42,915 --> 00:05:47,040
It'll give you more time to kind of react if something goes wrong,

104
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,439
and just more time to enjoy watching Backyard Flyer do its thing.

105
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:56,785
So we're going to go ahead and change this MPC_XY_CRUISE.

106
00:05:56,785 --> 00:05:58,990
So this is the cruise velocity.

107
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:03,129
This is the speed at which it's going to move in the XY plane.

108
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,725
And we're going to bring that down to four meters per second,

109
00:06:05,725 --> 00:06:08,890
which sounds slow but it definitely allows you

110
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:13,870
to really watch and see what's happening with the drone while it's flying.

111
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:16,209
So we'll hit save on that,

112
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,495
and then we'll go down and change that maximum velocity.

113
00:06:19,495 --> 00:06:23,072
We'll bring that down to five meters per second,

114
00:06:23,072 --> 00:06:25,000
and we'll go ahead and save that.

115
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,709
As you get more comfortable with flying your drone,

116
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:31,620
feel free to increase these numbers and see just how

117
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,949
quickly the arrow can actually fly the Backyard Flyer loop.

118
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:38,084
But for now, we'll keep things nice and slow.

119
00:06:38,084 --> 00:06:40,814
So with those last configuration changes made,

120
00:06:40,814 --> 00:06:42,975
we are good to go.

121
00:06:42,975 --> 00:06:44,445
We're ready to fly,

122
00:06:44,444 --> 00:06:46,844
provided we were outside with GPS.

123
00:06:46,845 --> 00:06:50,070
And now we can move on to making some changes to

124
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:53,909
the Backyard Flyer script to make sure it connects with our drone,

125
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:58,035
and we'll change a couple of the state machine elements.

126
00:06:58,035 --> 00:07:00,420
But that's for the next video.
