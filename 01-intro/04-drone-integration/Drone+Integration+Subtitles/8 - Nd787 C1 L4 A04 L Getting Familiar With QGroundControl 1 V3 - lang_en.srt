1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,049
Alright. So, one of the things we'll do to test out and

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:07,094
make sure everything is running properly on the autopilot is,

3
00:00:07,094 --> 00:00:09,929
I'm opening up a piece of software called, QGroundControl.

4
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:12,750
This is an open-source ground station software.

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,890
It's not like the simulator or what you've been interacting,

6
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,880
what the students have been interacting with the simulator,

7
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:22,500
and during the project.

8
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,589
This is an open-source ground station that's used commonly

9
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:30,195
for a lot of these more DIY style drones.

10
00:00:30,195 --> 00:00:32,909
And what it does is, it gives us state information.

11
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:38,854
It allows us to actually even see things like attitude information in real-time,

12
00:00:38,854 --> 00:00:44,719
and other configurations that we might have to change from the defaults.

13
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,909
This is the basic interface for QGroundControl,

14
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:50,704
and we've got our main window with our map,

15
00:00:50,704 --> 00:00:52,564
that's going to display where our drone is,

16
00:00:52,564 --> 00:00:54,844
and we've got a couple of tabs along the top.

17
00:00:54,844 --> 00:00:58,685
But really, there's not too much to look at until we connect a vehicle.

18
00:00:58,685 --> 00:01:01,250
So, let's go ahead and turn on our arrow,

19
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,799
make sure remote control first and no propellers.

20
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,670
And once that's on,

21
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,135
and up and running, let's connect to its network.

22
00:01:10,135 --> 00:01:12,550
Once its connected, QGroundControl will

23
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:15,519
automatically see that a new drone has been connected,

24
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:17,575
and will ask us to connect.

25
00:01:17,575 --> 00:01:20,950
So, we'll go ahead and allow that connection, and now,

26
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,484
you'll see we've got a few more options along the top,

27
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:25,254
and we've got this green loading bar.

28
00:01:25,254 --> 00:01:27,399
Once that green bar goes all the way across,

29
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,935
it means that all the parameters and settings

30
00:01:29,935 --> 00:01:32,650
from the drone have been downloaded into QGroundControl.

31
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,700
So, just to walk through the interface that we have in front of us here,

32
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,770
I'm going to start from the top bar and work my way across.

33
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:43,009
This "Q" button here,

34
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:47,675
this purple "Q" button is configuration files for Q ground control itself,

35
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:50,674
and also communication links.

36
00:01:50,674 --> 00:01:53,584
So, if it didn't automatically connect,

37
00:01:53,584 --> 00:01:56,629
this is where you can manually add different types of links,

38
00:01:56,629 --> 00:01:58,339
whether it's a serial connection,

39
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,094
if you're using something like

40
00:02:00,094 --> 00:02:06,804
a 3DR radio to connect to your drone or an internet-based connection.

41
00:02:06,805 --> 00:02:10,050
The next tab is going to be settings,

42
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,465
and this is where you'll find all the information

43
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:15,182
about the autopilot settings and configurations.

44
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:17,474
This is just a summary page that shows us

45
00:02:17,474 --> 00:02:21,659
the quick view of all the different states and important information.

46
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:25,259
You'll see there's a bunch of green dots along these tabs,

47
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:27,768
and that tells us things are configured and ready to go.

48
00:02:27,768 --> 00:02:30,000
If you just installed the autopilot,

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,500
you may notice some red circles,

50
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,960
and that tells you that you need to configure

51
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:37,724
some parameters before the autopilot will let you take off.

52
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:41,939
We got a whole list of different possible settings that we can look into,

53
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:45,125
which we'll come back to in a minute.

54
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:48,500
The next tab is for being able to do

55
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,810
high-level planning to use the autopilot's inbuilt mission handling.

56
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:57,259
We're actually not going to be using this tab for this Nanodegree,

57
00:02:57,259 --> 00:03:00,364
however, feel free to explore this on your own.

58
00:03:00,365 --> 00:03:03,350
The next tab is our main flight tab, and this is,

59
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:07,356
that's going to show us where our drone is currently on the map,

60
00:03:07,356 --> 00:03:14,074
and information like our current orientation and heading speed, and other information.

61
00:03:14,074 --> 00:03:19,359
And finally, this tab allows us to connect and look at logs that are on board the vehicle.

62
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,085
Again, we won't make too much use of this tab throughout this Nanodegree,

63
00:03:23,085 --> 00:03:25,770
but it's just so you know it's there.

64
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:30,240
Next, we have a bull horn for messages.

65
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,219
Right now, there's no messages from the drone,

66
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:35,219
but this is where important information, for example,

67
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:37,229
it telling you something isn't calibrated,

68
00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:40,979
or mode changes will appear here.

69
00:03:40,979 --> 00:03:43,744
Next, we have our GPS status.

70
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:45,525
Right now, we are inside,

71
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:49,167
so it's going to show us that we're not connected to any GPS signals.

72
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:51,870
But normally, what you're going to be looking for before you take off,

73
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,389
that you've got to account in above,

74
00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:57,570
probably eight is what you'll see,

75
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:01,289
and these numbers will be much smaller around one or two.

76
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:05,384
This tells us the controller information,

77
00:04:05,384 --> 00:04:08,084
the connection status to the remote control,

78
00:04:08,085 --> 00:04:12,270
which is on, but seems to be not providing data at the moment.

79
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,385
And finally, our battery status.

80
00:04:14,384 --> 00:04:16,589
So, this is the voltage of our current battery,

81
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:20,883
and it's going to go from 100 percent to somewhere around 30,

82
00:04:20,884 --> 00:04:23,699
40 percent, you should most definitely be landing.

83
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:26,579
This is our current flight mode that we have.

84
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:27,959
Right now, we're in manual,

85
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:31,864
which means that the pilot has the most basic amount of control,

86
00:04:31,865 --> 00:04:34,870
and we'll be able to cycle through those different modes,

87
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,170
things like altitude hold or position hold that we've mentioned

88
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:41,845
before as we change through those modes with our remote control,

89
00:04:41,845 --> 00:04:43,750
that will be updated here accordingly.

90
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,660
Finally, the armed versus disarmed state,

91
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:51,200
and that tells us, "Are the motors ready to spin and take commands?"
