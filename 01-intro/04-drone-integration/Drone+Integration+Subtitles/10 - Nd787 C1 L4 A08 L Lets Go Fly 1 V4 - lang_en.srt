1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,845
Adrien, we're ready to go.

2
00:00:01,845 --> 00:00:03,780
Why are we not flying it?

3
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:06,000
It's always nice to, kind of bench test to make sure

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,609
it works here before we go out and fly it.

5
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:10,559
Last thing you want to do is have everything set up,

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,480
be out on the field, turn on, it doesn't work.

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,019
Okay, we're going to do this with the props off.

8
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:16,710
Yeah, it's the safest thing.

9
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:18,250
If you're going to be right next to it,

10
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,355
you don't necessarily want these to start spinning up,

11
00:00:20,355 --> 00:00:22,484
and do something that you don't expect,

12
00:00:22,484 --> 00:00:23,989
maybe come and hit you.

13
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:27,599
So, it's always the nicest to take them off, set them on the bench.

14
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,545
Especially, if there are other quad-rotors around,

15
00:00:29,545 --> 00:00:31,320
you wouldn't want somebody else's transmitter to bind

16
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,130
to your vehicle and take off with the props on.

17
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:33,323
Very much, so.

18
00:00:33,323 --> 00:00:35,149
All right, cool. So, what's first?

19
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:36,359
So, first things first,

20
00:00:36,359 --> 00:00:38,719
we'll turn on our transmitter.

21
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,204
So, we're going to have control when we turn it on.

22
00:00:41,204 --> 00:00:43,844
We'll turn on our Aero.

23
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:44,110
Okay.

24
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,765
And that's going to take a minute to boot up.

25
00:00:45,765 --> 00:00:49,582
And it creates a Wi-Fi hotspot that we're going to connect to,

26
00:00:49,582 --> 00:00:53,564
and that's what's going to allow us to control and send different commands.

27
00:00:53,564 --> 00:00:55,169
And this is very similar even,

28
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,579
if you don't have an Intel Aero,

29
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:59,234
if you have one of the 3D robotics vehicles,

30
00:00:59,234 --> 00:01:01,019
or if you even have a DJI vehicles,

31
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,150
doing very similar things.

32
00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:03,161
Yep.

33
00:01:03,161 --> 00:01:08,739
Your password is 1-2-3-4-5?

34
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:12,354
No. It is always helpful when you log in.

35
00:01:12,355 --> 00:01:15,590
Well done. I've got to change my login now.

36
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,355
So, couple of things I'm checking are,

37
00:01:18,355 --> 00:01:21,093
one, up here, just to look at the fact that we have got GPS.

38
00:01:21,093 --> 00:01:23,048
So, right now we've got 17 satellites.

39
00:01:23,048 --> 00:01:24,882
And we've got a GPS lock.

40
00:01:24,882 --> 00:01:26,050
It's a pretty good position.

41
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:26,206
Great.

42
00:01:26,206 --> 00:01:28,209
So, we're showing up. The other things,

43
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:30,524
I'm just going to double check is that,

44
00:01:30,525 --> 00:01:33,240
my mode switches are configured the way I want.

45
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:35,564
So, mode switches allow me, as the pilot,

46
00:01:35,564 --> 00:01:39,370
to change the control methods of the drone.

47
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:43,936
So, whether I'm flying manually or in something called altitude hold.

48
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,605
So, where it's holding altitude or position control,

49
00:01:46,605 --> 00:01:49,170
where it's holding position or most importantly,

50
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,939
off board, which gives the script the control of the drone.

51
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:54,909
So, I like to just quickly look here.

52
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:56,021
It says manual.

53
00:01:56,022 --> 00:02:00,878
It says altitude position,

54
00:02:00,878 --> 00:02:04,420
and then, it's going to reject off-board because it does run when it needs to.

55
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,930
So, I just always like to double check that my switches are configured the way we want.

56
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:08,437
Great.

57
00:02:08,437 --> 00:02:11,865
So, I'm confident everything's working well on autopilot here.

58
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:14,890
So, we're going to close out a key ground control.

59
00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:16,734
All right, so now, we're ready to run the script.

60
00:02:16,735 --> 00:02:18,300
So, we're going to run the script and so, it's just going to

61
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,930
wait there for everything to be set,

62
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,143
for the pilot to give it control,

63
00:02:21,143 --> 00:02:22,539
and then, it should take off.

64
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:22,909
Terrific.

65
00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:27,259
So, what I'm going to do is, I'm going to arm the motors.

66
00:02:27,259 --> 00:02:29,379
You see the motor started to spin and they're just idling.

67
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:33,409
And then, I'm going to give control of the vehicle to the script.

68
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:36,264
We see the motors spins, so it's armed.

69
00:02:36,264 --> 00:02:39,319
And then, we hear the motor spin up.

70
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:41,319
As it's trying to take off.

71
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:45,030
Script actually fix as trying to run the vehicle.

72
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,479
Of course, a vehicle without the props on,

73
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,079
can't actually do the mission right now.

74
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,990
So, great, let's stop this.

75
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:52,564
And I'm actually, going to take it.

76
00:02:52,564 --> 00:02:54,990
So now, I've taken it out of control.

77
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,760
I've killed the motors. Now, I can turn off the script.

78
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,324
Great.

79
00:02:58,324 --> 00:03:00,049
So now, we know everything works.

80
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:02,510
We can put the props on and go fly the mission for real.

81
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:02,610
Yep.

82
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,139
Let's go do that.

83
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:04,199
Let's do it.

84
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,894
All right. So, Adrian, we're here,

85
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:08,960
we got the vehicle on the pad with the props on, ready to go?

86
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,570
Yeah. So, you can go ahead and get that script started.

87
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:13,939
Okay, before we do that, let's check to make sure the airspace is clear.

88
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:16,849
See, no one else is flying right now.

89
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:16,989
Nope.

90
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,740
And everyone is well behind us.

91
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,935
Great.

92
00:03:19,935 --> 00:03:21,530
And we can see on the screen that the vehicle

93
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,449
is on the overhead map where we expect it to be.

94
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:27,359
Good. All right, I will go ahead and start the script.

95
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,825
And now, I'm going to arm the motors,

96
00:03:29,824 --> 00:03:32,849
and now, I'm going to give control of the vehicle to the script.

97
00:03:32,849 --> 00:03:34,609
I see the motors armed.

98
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,100
And there we go, and it's taking off.

99
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:39,019
Going to three meters.

100
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:44,380
And now, it's off to its first waypoint.

101
00:03:44,379 --> 00:04:06,409
First waypoint, second waypoint,

102
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:13,889
third waypoint,

103
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:16,919
and coming home.

104
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:29,019
Very nice.

105
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:32,004
So, now I'll take control of the drone again.

106
00:04:32,004 --> 00:04:34,300
So, I can then disarm it manually.

107
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:34,783
Okay, I'll kill the script.

108
00:04:34,783 --> 00:04:36,949
There we go.

109
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:40,555
And that's another difference between what we've done with this script here,

110
00:04:40,555 --> 00:04:41,875
and what we see on the simulator.

111
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,677
On the simulator, once it detects it's landed,

112
00:04:44,677 --> 00:04:47,403
it will disarm the motors and kill the script.

113
00:04:47,403 --> 00:04:49,150
While here, we're going to leave it to

114
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:51,399
the pilot to take back control of disarming the motors.

115
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:54,000
All right, terrific. And nice work on the autopilot.
