1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,330
Orville and Wilbur Wright were the first people to fly a manned and powered

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,795
airplane back in 1903 near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.

3
00:00:06,795 --> 00:00:10,590
Many people before them had been trying to figure out how to fly.

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:11,910
But no one else had succeeded,

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,390
because they were attempting to make planes that were very stable and easy to control.

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,210
These earlier planes were designed to keep flying and

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,435
just needed the pilot to steer, as if navigating a ship.

8
00:00:21,435 --> 00:00:24,315
The Wright brothers spent time watching how birds fly,

9
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:27,090
lying on their backs out on the sand dunes near Kitty Hawk,

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:29,870
watching the buzzards wheel around up in the sky.

11
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:33,775
They noticed that the bird swooped and turned by constantly adjusting themselves,

12
00:00:33,775 --> 00:00:35,097
reacting to the wind,

13
00:00:35,097 --> 00:00:36,670
doing things like changing the shape of

14
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,790
their wings to induce a bank maneuver in a given direction.

15
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,550
The key thing they discovered by watching the birds,

16
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:45,370
was that stable flight requires active control.

17
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:50,290
Previous aircraft designs that had attempted to enable passive stability had failed,

18
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,210
because flight is inherently dynamic.

19
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,637
The Wright brothers design their airplane,

20
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,125
not to be particularly stable,

21
00:00:56,125 --> 00:01:00,220
but it gave the pilot much more control through things like adjustable wings

22
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,495
that'll let the pilot fly just like a bird.

23
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:05,430
These adjustable wings and other controls that they had,

24
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,880
they were the early forerunners of modern control surfaces like ailerons.

25
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,860
The sacrifice of stability in exchange for

26
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,605
greater control is what made the first flight successful.

27
00:01:13,605 --> 00:01:16,005
Once the Wright brothers were in the air, however,

28
00:01:16,005 --> 00:01:19,410
they found that controlling the aircraft had built and navigating in flight.

29
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,870
These are really complicated tasks to do together,

30
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:25,440
and required the pilot to be simultaneously keeping the aircraft level,

31
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,255
while maintaining a particular heading,

32
00:01:27,255 --> 00:01:30,105
and keeping an eye on the ground to know where they were on the map.

33
00:01:30,105 --> 00:01:34,845
The Wright Brothers and other folks struggled with how to make flying less complicated.

34
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:38,055
And just about 10 years later, in 1912,

35
00:01:38,055 --> 00:01:41,130
Elmer Sperry invented the very first autopilot known as

36
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,600
the Mechanical Mike which was basically a device with a couple of gyroscopes inside,

37
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,405
that allowed for monitoring the heading and pitch of the aircraft

38
00:01:48,405 --> 00:01:51,780
in order to automatically stay on a level and stable trajectory.

39
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:54,225
Airplanes were not yet completely autonomous.

40
00:01:54,225 --> 00:01:55,485
But as you can already see,

41
00:01:55,485 --> 00:01:56,940
more than 100 years ago,

42
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,880
we'd begun building semi-autonomous flying machines.

43
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,525
The past century has seen dramatic improvements to autopilot technology.

44
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:06,915
And now, commercial aircraft routinely fly for

45
00:02:06,915 --> 00:02:09,705
hours at a time in fully autonomous autopilot mode.

46
00:02:09,705 --> 00:02:12,270
And the military flies planes with no pilot on board at all.
