1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,459
We started off this lesson with a bit of

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:05,250
a history of flight and in particular, autonomous flight.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:06,960
Fast-forward to the modern day,

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,705
and we're on the cusp of a transformation in technology,

5
00:00:09,705 --> 00:00:11,835
where flying cars will become a reality.

6
00:00:11,835 --> 00:00:16,065
I introduced our test platform for studying autonomous flight, the quadrotor drone.

7
00:00:16,065 --> 00:00:19,650
I covered the basics of what components go into a quadrotor and

8
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:23,399
how they function together as an autonomous flying machine.

9
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:25,169
While the sensors and

10
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,785
mechanical components of a drone are interesting in their own right,

11
00:00:28,785 --> 00:00:32,939
the flight computer is the brain of the whole operation and really,

12
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:35,085
where the most exciting stuff happens.

13
00:00:35,085 --> 00:00:36,774
So, in this program,

14
00:00:36,774 --> 00:00:40,158
we'll be focused primarily on writing software for the flight computer.

15
00:00:40,158 --> 00:00:42,844
We'll look at how to do basic autonomous flight,

16
00:00:42,844 --> 00:00:46,143
3D motion planning, implementing different control loops,

17
00:00:46,145 --> 00:00:48,635
state estimation, and much more.

18
00:00:48,634 --> 00:00:50,838
That said, we won't lose sight of

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,435
the fact that the software you write for your flight computer,

20
00:00:53,435 --> 00:00:57,020
needs to actually function on real hardware at the end of the day.

21
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:59,240
So, while the projects you complete for

22
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,940
this program will be carried out in a simulator at first,

23
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:06,468
we'll also be showing you how to port your project code onto a real vehicle,

24
00:01:06,468 --> 00:01:08,375
should you be inspired to do so.

25
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:13,019
Next up, your first project: event-driven programming for autonomous flight.
