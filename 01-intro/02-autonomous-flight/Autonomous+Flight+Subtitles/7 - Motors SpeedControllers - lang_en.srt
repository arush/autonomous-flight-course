1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,590
Once you have a frame, you need motors.

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:04,900
And most quadrotors use electric motors,

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:06,370
which are very easy to work with.

4
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,825
They don't have complicated carburetors and other mechanisms for mixing fuel and air,

5
00:00:10,825 --> 00:00:14,440
like the carbon-based fuel engines used on more traditional remote control aircraft.

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,975
They're also much safer than combustion engines.

7
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,790
The downside of electric motors,

8
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,395
is they're not very efficient.

9
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:25,570
Battery technology is just not as good at delivering energy as carbon-based fuels,

10
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:28,060
and the way that electric motors convert

11
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,075
that energy into flight power is also not as efficient.

12
00:00:31,075 --> 00:00:33,610
But, electric motors are easy to work with,

13
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:37,302
and they are what you generally find in most quadrotors.

14
00:00:37,302 --> 00:00:40,425
More specifically, most qudrotors, like this,

15
00:00:40,425 --> 00:00:44,844
use brushless motors, which operate by oscillating magnetic field.

16
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:48,990
That oscillation cause the magnets inside the motor to spin the motor shaft.

17
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:51,570
These motors are called brushless because of the fact that there's

18
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,095
no contact between the control mechanism and the motor shaft,

19
00:00:55,095 --> 00:00:57,530
in contrast to more traditional brushed motors,

20
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,765
where the drive and the shaft are in contact via brushes.

21
00:01:00,765 --> 00:01:04,955
This lack of contact allows brushless motors to spin faster and more efficiently.

22
00:01:04,955 --> 00:01:07,975
As far as the discussion of motors goes, I'm going to leave it at that.

23
00:01:07,975 --> 00:01:12,235
But check out the links below to learn more about brushed versus brushless motors.

24
00:01:12,235 --> 00:01:14,965
And that takes us to the next component of the quadrotor,

25
00:01:14,965 --> 00:01:18,415
which is called the electronic speed controller, or ESC.

26
00:01:18,415 --> 00:01:23,065
Each of the four ESCs in your quadrotor receives a signal from the autopilot saying,

27
00:01:23,065 --> 00:01:26,215
spin that particular motor at a particular rpm.

28
00:01:26,215 --> 00:01:29,635
And then the ESC oscillates the magnetic field at the appropriate rate,

29
00:01:29,635 --> 00:01:31,135
in order to spin the motor.

30
00:01:31,135 --> 00:01:33,085
So now you've got your motor's spinning,

31
00:01:33,085 --> 00:01:35,575
and the whole point is for your motors to spin your propellers.

32
00:01:35,575 --> 00:01:37,940
So, up next, propellers.
