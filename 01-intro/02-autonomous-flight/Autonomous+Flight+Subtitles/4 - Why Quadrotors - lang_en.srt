1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,350
We'll be using the quadrotor drone as our test platform for learning about flying cars.

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,330
But first, I figure we should pause for

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,060
a moment and talk about just what to call these things.

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,175
Within the world of flying robots,

5
00:00:12,175 --> 00:00:16,120
you'll hear people argue about whether the proper name is UAV or UAS,

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,050
which stands for unmanned aerial vehicle or unmanned aerial system.

7
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:22,330
You'll also hear the names quadrotor,

8
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:26,020
quadcopter, multirotor, and drone used to describe these.

9
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,815
For our purposes, the name is not particularly relevant, call it what you will.

10
00:00:29,815 --> 00:00:33,010
We'll be working with a small helicopter that has four rotors.

11
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:37,050
I might sometimes called the drone a quadrotor or maybe even just a quad,

12
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,660
but just know that I'm always referring to the same thing.

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,135
You might also wonder why four rotors,

14
00:00:42,135 --> 00:00:45,015
why not three or six or eight?

15
00:00:45,015 --> 00:00:47,730
The truth is that other multi rotor configurations

16
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,040
would be equally valid as an experimental platform.

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,770
But the convenience symmetry of quadrotors and

18
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,515
the fact that they are the most common drones available for purchase,

19
00:00:55,515 --> 00:00:57,615
make them an obvious choice for this program.

20
00:00:57,615 --> 00:01:01,020
So, why are people talking so much about drones these days?

21
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,690
Well, a couple of things have changed in recent years.

22
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,919
They make this an exciting time to be working on them.

23
00:01:06,919 --> 00:01:11,760
One is that we now have low cost high power microelectronics that have allowed us to take

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,514
the autopilots that have kept aircraft flying on

25
00:01:14,514 --> 00:01:17,910
a straight and level for many decades and make them much cheaper,

26
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:22,380
smaller, and lighter so that we can put them on much smaller aircraft.

27
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,610
We want these tiny aircraft to perform more and more complicated missions so that as

28
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,660
we take the human pilot out of

29
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,765
the equation we need to replace that human with a computer.

30
00:01:30,765 --> 00:01:33,240
So another advantage of cheap microelectronics

31
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,760
is that small computers are widely available and

32
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,160
capable of performing complex in-flight data

33
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:41,085
crunching tasks that used to require a human brain.

34
00:01:41,085 --> 00:01:44,100
Another thing that has changed is how we power our aircraft.

35
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,160
Most aircraft for the past 100 years had been powered using

36
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,320
carbon-based fuels such as jet fuel or gasoline.

37
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,230
But now we have access to high energy density batteries and

38
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:57,370
high power density batteries that can be used to power small aircraft like a quadrotor.

39
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:01,180
And finally, a major development in the last 30 years or so has

40
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,870
been the availability of the global positioning system or GPS.

41
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:08,020
A small drone can now be outfitted with a GPS receiver and get

42
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:12,895
constant updates on its position which is a tremendous aid to autonomous navigation.

43
00:02:12,895 --> 00:02:14,605
So with the advent of

44
00:02:14,605 --> 00:02:18,130
powerful lightweight computers and batteries as well as GPS for navigation,

45
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:21,160
we're at an amazing moment in history where tiny flying machines can

46
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,580
autonomously perform incredibly complex tasks and that is

47
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,650
why the modern quadrotor drone serves as

48
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:31,450
a perfect test platform for developing algorithms to control the flying car.

49
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:35,050
Now, you might already own a quadcopter or you might be

50
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:39,205
considering building one to test your code on as you go through this program.

51
00:02:39,205 --> 00:02:41,200
So next, I'll talk a bit about

52
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,740
the various components that make up a quadrotor drone and what

53
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,590
the trade-offs are in each case when deciding

54
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:51,770
which components to select if you decide to build your own drone.
