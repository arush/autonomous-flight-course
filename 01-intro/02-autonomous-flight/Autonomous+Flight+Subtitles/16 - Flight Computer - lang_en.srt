1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,380
So, now you have a quadrotor consisting of an airframe with motors,

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,638
and propellers, and speed controllers,

3
00:00:06,638 --> 00:00:09,540
being driven by an autopilot to adjust the vehicle attitude,

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:11,880
which is constantly being measured by the IMU,

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,190
and your position is provided by GPS.

6
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,040
But then what? How do you execute a mission?

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,640
Of course, you could just have a human pilot,

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:22,095
but this program is all about autonomous flight.

9
00:00:22,095 --> 00:00:23,955
So how do you replace the human?

10
00:00:23,955 --> 00:00:26,550
Well, you need a brain on board of course,

11
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:29,280
and the flight computer will be the brain for the vehicle.

12
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,425
The flight computer, like this one,

13
00:00:31,425 --> 00:00:35,670
is generally responsible for all parts of the mission including for example,

14
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:38,670
planning a safe trajectory through obstacles and managing

15
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,527
the payload or position estimation when GPS's flaking them.

16
00:00:42,527 --> 00:00:44,295
If the flight computer is the brain,

17
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:48,000
you can think of the autopilot as more like the spinal cord or lizard

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,058
brain stem of the vehicle responsible for lower level processes.

19
00:00:52,058 --> 00:00:54,870
And then, the flight computer is responsible for

20
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,725
higher level functions like deciding what the vehicle should do next,

21
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,875
and how it should respond to new information.

22
00:01:01,875 --> 00:01:03,375
There are in fact,

23
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:08,640
multiple levels of control on any autonomous system and drones are no exception.

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,410
The way the whole system;

25
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,460
the flight computer, autopilot, sensors,

26
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,740
and mechanical parts function together

27
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,590
is through a series of what are known as control loops.

28
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,510
So let's draw this out.

29
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,099
First, you have your autopilot,

30
00:01:23,099 --> 00:01:26,360
which is getting information about attitude from the IMU.

31
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:31,130
It compares that with a target attitude and send's small adjustments to the motors,

32
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,843
which act to change the attitude of the quad,

33
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:37,595
and the cycle continues with the IMU making a new measurement.

34
00:01:37,595 --> 00:01:40,330
So, this is the attitude control loop,

35
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,410
where the autopilot is constantly updating the motor

36
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,305
thrusts based on sensor data from the IMU.

37
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:47,970
This loop is always running in the background and just like

38
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,095
your brainstem keeps your vital organs working without you having to pay attention.

39
00:01:52,095 --> 00:01:53,666
On top of that,

40
00:01:53,666 --> 00:01:55,125
there's a position control loop.

41
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:56,805
Sometimes it's in the autopilot,

42
00:01:56,805 --> 00:02:00,600
but more often it's in the flight computer where the position control loop is receiving

43
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,755
information about the vehicle position from GPS or other sensors,

44
00:02:04,755 --> 00:02:09,345
and computing a target thrust vector in order to move to the desired position.

45
00:02:09,345 --> 00:02:12,735
That thrust vector command is then sent to the autopilot loop,

46
00:02:12,735 --> 00:02:15,540
which in turn adjusts the motor thrusts to achieve

47
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,860
that new attitude and the cycle continues with the GPS making new measurements.

48
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,690
These loops do not need to be synchronized and most often they're not.

49
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:28,210
The autopilot loop might be executing at 50 cycles per second or 50 hertz.

50
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:31,090
While the position loop might only be executing a few times per second.

51
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,525
So the way this works is that for instance,

52
00:02:34,525 --> 00:02:36,670
if the mission is to inspect a wind turbine,

53
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:40,825
the flight computer will be responsible for working out how to fly that mission

54
00:02:40,825 --> 00:02:43,060
or in other words what the vehicle trajectory should

55
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,790
look like as a series of positions in space.

56
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,430
And the autopilot will be responsible for executing

57
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,890
that plan as it gets regular updates from

58
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,840
the flight computer on how to adjust

59
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,808
the thrust vector to arrive at the desired series of positions.

60
00:02:56,808 --> 00:02:57,874
And there you have it.

61
00:02:57,874 --> 00:02:59,690
Your quadrotor has a brain!
