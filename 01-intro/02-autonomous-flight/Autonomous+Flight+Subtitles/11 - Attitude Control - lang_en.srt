1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,430
So really, the secret to success in

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:05,355
controlling a quadrotor is all about having the right attitude.

3
00:00:05,355 --> 00:00:07,815
Get it? Me neither.

4
00:00:07,815 --> 00:00:10,530
The attitude of the quadrotor actually has nothing to do with

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,085
inherent personality but rather with its orientation in space.

6
00:00:14,085 --> 00:00:15,870
So now, it's time to think about how to characterize

7
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,910
the orientation of these things that flies around.

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:20,310
Basically, there are three axes of interest.

9
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,055
If we say that this is the front of the vehicle,

10
00:00:23,055 --> 00:00:26,355
then the pitch angle describes how much is tilted forward or backward.

11
00:00:26,355 --> 00:00:29,790
The roll angle describes how much is tilted to the left or the right.

12
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,285
And the yaw angle how much has turned about the vertical axis.

13
00:00:33,285 --> 00:00:35,430
We'll talk more about more precise ways to

14
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,935
describe the vehicle attitude in future lessons.

15
00:00:37,935 --> 00:00:40,620
But roughly speaking, these three angles, roll, pitch, and yaw,

16
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,750
are commonly referred to as the Euler angles after

17
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,900
the famous mathematician Leonhard Euler and basically,

18
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,870
what's happening as these rotors spin faster

19
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,125
or slower and put more or less force on each rotor arm,

20
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:54,315
there's a different total amount of thrust and

21
00:00:54,315 --> 00:00:56,640
torque being produced by the combination of

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,460
all four rotors and that acts like a vector that follows the attitude of the vehicle.

23
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:05,375
So, the name of the game in controlling a quadrotor is spinning each of the rotors

24
00:01:05,375 --> 00:01:10,235
faster slower in order to aim the thrust vector in one direction or another.

25
00:01:10,235 --> 00:01:12,020
You want to move the vehicle forward?

26
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,375
Aim the thrust vector in that direction.

27
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:16,565
Want to make the vehicle move faster?

28
00:01:16,565 --> 00:01:19,670
Increase the magnitude and angle of the thrust vector.

29
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,200
Want to stop really fast?

30
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,170
Make the vehicle pitch backwards in a thrust hard.

31
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,200
So, it doesn't take long to realize that

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,440
manually controlling the rotation speed of each of the four propellers on

33
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,435
your quad in order to maintain

34
00:01:32,435 --> 00:01:36,525
a certain thrust vector or change directions would be really difficult.

35
00:01:36,525 --> 00:01:38,715
This is essentially the same problem

36
00:01:38,715 --> 00:01:42,030
the Wright brothers faced after they got their airplane flying.

37
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,060
It can be just really hard to manually control different kinds of

38
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,555
flying machines and that means we need an autopilot.

39
00:01:48,555 --> 00:01:50,740
So, that's what we're going to talk about next.
