00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,960
Over the last few lessons,

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,014
you've seen how crucial state estimation is for autonomous flight.

3
00:00:06,014 --> 00:00:09,974
To perform good state estimation we need a few things.

4
00:00:09,974 --> 00:00:12,809
First, we need a good understanding of

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,810
our vehicles dynamics which we capture an emotion model for the vehicle.

6
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:22,784
Next, we need good sensors and a measurement model that allows us to

7
00:00:22,785 --> 00:00:25,530
probabilistically update our state estimate

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,910
when we get new information from those sensors.

9
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,960
Finally, we need an algorithm that can

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,335
effectively stitch all of these components together.

11
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:38,299
In the projects you've completed up until now,

12
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:41,759
we've taken the vehicle state for granted, for example,

13
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,239
when you implemented a controller you were given the exact state of the vehicle.

14
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,890
In the final project for this module you'll implement an estimator to

15
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:56,240
estimate the state of a quadrotor which moves in three-dimensions. Good luck!
