1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,714
So, we're getting to the end of the course.

2
00:00:02,714 --> 00:00:04,339
We want to share some content with you.

3
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:06,120
It is not required for the final project,

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,370
but it's important when you build actual physical systems.

5
00:00:09,369 --> 00:00:13,989
It has to do with the fact that so far we have a very strong reliance on GPS.

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,210
Or else it will just not work without GPS,

7
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,714
because if you don't know where you are,

8
00:00:17,714 --> 00:00:21,149
you could start drifting at a certain speed and never figure that out.

9
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:25,719
The only way to prevent a flyaway scenario is using GPS.

10
00:00:25,719 --> 00:00:28,099
Sometimes, GPS is not available.

11
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,230
This might be because you are next to tall buildings or

12
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,450
it might be because someone has a GPS Gema,

13
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,050
that's actually exist and GPS is not able.

14
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:39,714
So, now we're going to give you some information on how to make

15
00:00:39,715 --> 00:00:42,660
a drone fly without GPS and we're going to replace

16
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:48,439
GPS using a downward facing camera as a way to track your position on the ground.
