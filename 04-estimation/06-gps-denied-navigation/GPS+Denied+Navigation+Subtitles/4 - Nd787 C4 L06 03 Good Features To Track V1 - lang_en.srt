1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,935
The first thing we need to do to get a velocity estimate for the vehicle,

2
00:00:03,935 --> 00:00:08,970
is to recover the uv velocity vector from the image that the camera sees.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,429
Let's start by looking at how we estimate

4
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:14,099
the motion of a vehicle from a downward-facing camera.

5
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:17,870
If we have two images taken from two positions of the camera,

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,530
then we can see how much the scene appears to have moved from image to image,

7
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:24,265
which tells us how much the camera must have moved.

8
00:00:24,265 --> 00:00:26,375
Now, there's many ways to do this,

9
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,199
and it's by no means a solved problem.

10
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,559
The simplest way you can frame the problem is just

11
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:33,030
to work out the relative velocity of the camera.

12
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,109
But you can take the problem all the way to working out

13
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:38,119
the exact position of the camera at each point in

14
00:00:38,119 --> 00:00:40,695
time and the entire geometry of the scene.

15
00:00:40,695 --> 00:00:45,890
That process is called visual simultaneous localization and mapping or visual slam.

16
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,950
Regardless of how complicated we make the problem,

17
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,140
the first step is being able to reliably

18
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:54,210
recognize the same part of the scene from image to image.

19
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,450
Such points we call, features.

20
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:59,370
There are lots of ways to find good features,

21
00:00:59,369 --> 00:01:03,269
but the basic idea is that good features or points in the image are

22
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,515
ones that we can easily localize by looking through a small window of the image.

23
00:01:07,515 --> 00:01:09,730
Shifting the window in any direction,

24
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:13,060
should give a large change in pixel intensities of the window.

25
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,814
Which makes the location precisely defined.

26
00:01:15,814 --> 00:01:17,730
If we look at this figure,

27
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,990
we see that we have a small window over this flat grey plane portion of the image,

28
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:23,969
and if we perturb the window on the image,

29
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:26,745
what we see through the window hasn't changed at all.

30
00:01:26,745 --> 00:01:30,145
That means that this location is a bad place to put a feature.

31
00:01:30,144 --> 00:01:36,019
We'll have a really hard time figuring out where exactly the feature is in future images.

32
00:01:36,019 --> 00:01:38,780
Now, if we move our window to this part of the image,

33
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,210
you can see that if you move the window left and right,

34
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:43,849
what you would see is that the image changes quite a bit.

35
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:46,429
But if you move the window up and down,

36
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,330
then the image isn't going to change it all along that line.

37
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:52,340
This means at this particular location is a better place

38
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,090
for feature than the gray flat field, but still not great.

39
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,219
On the other hand,

40
00:01:57,219 --> 00:02:02,359
if we put a feature right here and we move the window up and down or left and right,

41
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:04,540
the image is going to change quite a bit.

42
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,365
We see here at this location,

43
00:02:06,364 --> 00:02:08,704
there's a significant change in all directions.

44
00:02:08,705 --> 00:02:11,390
That means that this is a good place to put a feature,

45
00:02:11,389 --> 00:02:13,069
and it also means the local image at

46
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:17,259
this location is going to be easy to recognize in future frames.

47
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:19,203
In your next exercise,

48
00:02:19,204 --> 00:02:22,460
you're going to take advantage of a toolkit that provides

49
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:26,465
a method to extract features which are called Good Features to Track.

50
00:02:26,465 --> 00:02:29,180
By Shi and Tomasi. And the Shi and

51
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,420
Tomasi Good Features to Track are called good features,

52
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:36,039
because they are easy to recognize from image to image.
