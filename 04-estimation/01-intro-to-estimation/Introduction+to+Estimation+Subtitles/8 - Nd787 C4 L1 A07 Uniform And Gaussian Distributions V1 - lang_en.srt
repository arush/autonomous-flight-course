1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,535
The uniform distribution that you just saw,

2
00:00:02,535 --> 00:00:05,415
was parameterized by the parameters A and B.

3
00:00:05,415 --> 00:00:08,669
In general, a probability distribution will typically be

4
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:12,365
parameterized by some small number of parameters.

5
00:00:12,365 --> 00:00:15,449
We will use theta to collectively refer to all of

6
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:18,750
the parameters that describe a particular distribution.

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:23,460
One thing to emphasize is that P of X given theta is not

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,469
the same thing as saying the function that

9
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:28,769
describes the density of X is parameterized by theta.

10
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:32,354
This particular condition here P of X given theta,

11
00:00:32,354 --> 00:00:35,750
implies theta is a random variable itself.

12
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,284
What can be the parameters of a density function?

13
00:00:39,284 --> 00:00:42,509
Well, two common distributions are the Uniform,

14
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,795
and the Gaussian, or the normal.

15
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:48,245
The uniform has a couple different ways to parameterized it.

16
00:00:48,244 --> 00:00:50,744
There is the A and B bounds you just saw,

17
00:00:50,744 --> 00:00:53,609
or we could say that we have say a mean,

18
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:57,994
and we have a width, and this is mu minus w, mu plus w,

19
00:00:57,994 --> 00:01:01,094
and the height of this distribution is one over two w,

20
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:03,960
the mean of this distribution is that mu,

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,439
and the standard deviation winds up being w over root three,

22
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,575
which makes the variance equal to w squared over three.

23
00:01:10,575 --> 00:01:14,269
This distribution says all possible outcomes are equally likely,

24
00:01:14,269 --> 00:01:16,799
and sometimes this is the only thing we can do when we have

25
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,894
no idea what the parametric family p of x actually is.

26
00:01:20,894 --> 00:01:25,379
The other distribution that we'll see most of the time in this module is the Gaussian.

27
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:27,929
It's the familiar bell shaped curve,

28
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,365
centered at some mu,

29
00:01:29,364 --> 00:01:31,530
with some width given by sigma.

30
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,189
The density function is given by p of x equals one,

31
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:37,319
divided by the square root of two pi,

32
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:43,539
sigma squared times e to the negative x minus mu all square over two sigma squared.

33
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,960
The Gaussian has a few interesting properties.

34
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:48,689
First, it's symmetric around the mean mu.

35
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:52,500
Second, the probability that x is within plus or minus one,

36
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,140
standard deviation of mu is 68 percent,

37
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,944
and the probability that it's within plus or minus three sigma is 99.7 percent.

38
00:01:59,944 --> 00:02:03,779
Notice how sigma describes how wide the distribution is.

39
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,129
When sigma's small, that will make the peak narrow and sharp,

40
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:09,240
and this implies that we have a high confidence of

41
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,260
predicting what a sample drawn from x will be.

42
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:14,454
When sigma is large the Gaussian,

43
00:02:14,455 --> 00:02:17,060
the normal distribution is very wide and flat,

44
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,235
and that means we have poor knowledge of what exactly

45
00:02:20,235 --> 00:02:23,520
any given sample from this distribution is going to look like.

46
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,340
So, you can see that a continuous distribution like a Gaussian,

47
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:33,150
can actually be fully described by two parameters mu and sigma squared,

48
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,200
and taking together, these parameters are the theta for this distribution,

49
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,744
that I referenced earlier.

50
00:02:38,745 --> 00:02:43,770
Solving estimation problems often boils down to using data often from sensors,

51
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:47,200
to come up with estimates for the values of these parameters.
