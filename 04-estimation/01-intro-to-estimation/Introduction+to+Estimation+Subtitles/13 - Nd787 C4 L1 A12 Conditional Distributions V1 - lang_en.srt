1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
Another useful property of

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:06,570
joint random variables is that it's often of extreme interest to find a density of one of

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,919
the unknown random variables given specific knowledge of other random variables.

4
00:00:10,919 --> 00:00:15,929
For instance, is a vehicle moving given the current state of the propulsion system?

5
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:20,774
Written this way we have the Joint distribution p of x and y.

6
00:00:20,774 --> 00:00:23,909
But we often want to know what's p of x given y?

7
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,969
And that is a conditional distribution.

8
00:00:25,969 --> 00:00:29,204
A very useful rule and probability is that

9
00:00:29,204 --> 00:00:32,519
p of x given y is equal to the joint divided by the

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,910
marginal of the conditioning variable that is p of x

11
00:00:35,909 --> 00:00:39,764
given y is p of x and y divided by p of y.

12
00:00:39,765 --> 00:00:41,880
This rule is called the chain rule.

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,100
A really useful application is

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,980
sometimes we want to reverse our conditional probabilities.

15
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:51,609
Recall our thought experiment of the autonomous UAV receiving GPS measurements.

16
00:00:51,609 --> 00:00:54,089
Let's call the GPS measurements y,

17
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,920
and these measurements are noisy.

18
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:03,375
We could estimate our position x as a conditional probability using p of x given y.

19
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:07,064
And remember this can be read as the probability of position x,

20
00:01:07,064 --> 00:01:09,254
given GPS measurements y.

21
00:01:09,254 --> 00:01:11,069
If we've acquired a model of

22
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:13,229
the position probability density function

23
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:15,960
given a measurement then we have everything we need,

24
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:18,119
but it's often much easier to obtain

25
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,770
a model of the measurement distribution given a position,

26
00:01:20,769 --> 00:01:22,454
p of y given x.

27
00:01:22,454 --> 00:01:25,439
We can apply the chain rule twice to derive

28
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,715
an expression for p of x given y for p of y given x.

29
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:31,780
This is what is known as Bayes rule.

30
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:34,260
And Bayes rule in Bayesian estimation is

31
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,755
a foundational concept in estimations of statistics in general.

32
00:01:37,754 --> 00:01:42,699
Bayesian techniques have enabled a huge amount of autonomy in a variety of ways.
