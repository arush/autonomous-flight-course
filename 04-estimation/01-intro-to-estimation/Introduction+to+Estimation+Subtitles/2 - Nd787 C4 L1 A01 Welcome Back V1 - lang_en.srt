00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,379
Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,379 --> 00:00:04,889
At this point, you've learned how to plan paths for a flying vehicle,

3
00:00:04,889 --> 00:00:08,984
and how to control a flying vehicle so it can actually fly along those paths.

4
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:10,980
That's right, but up until now,

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,600
we've made an assumption that we can't

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,865
make when we're working with a real flying vehicle.

7
00:00:14,865 --> 00:00:18,329
We've assumed that we always know what the state of the vehicles is.

8
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:20,789
Exactly. For example, the controller you just

9
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:24,599
implemented was somehow able to use the vehicle state variables like X,

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,580
Y, and Z, in its control logic.

11
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:30,264
In reality, we never know the vehicle state with certainty.

12
00:00:30,265 --> 00:00:31,960
It's something that has to be estimated.

13
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,660
So, in this lesson and the lessons that follow,

14
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:37,779
you'll learn how we can estimate the state of a flying vehicle.

15
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,100
And in the project that follows,

16
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,920
you'll implement your own estimator for a quadrotor.
