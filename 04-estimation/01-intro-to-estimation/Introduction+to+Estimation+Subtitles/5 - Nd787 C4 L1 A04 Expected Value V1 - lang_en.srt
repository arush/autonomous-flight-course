00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,025
One calculation, we can perform with a random variable is called the expected value.

2
00:00:05,025 --> 00:00:07,370
I can define this expected value here,

3
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:11,625
which you can see is a function of the components of the random variable.

4
00:00:11,625 --> 00:00:14,539
It's the integer value of the random variable,

5
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:18,410
times the likelihood of each of those outcomes all summed together.

6
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,039
Now, the expected value of a random variable,

7
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:23,719
where the underlying events are

8
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:28,279
truly non-numeric quantities such as working or not working,

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,065
they may not be all that useful.

10
00:00:30,065 --> 00:00:33,325
Let's say that we had working is zero, not working is one,

11
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:35,185
and mostly working is two,

12
00:00:35,185 --> 00:00:39,594
the probabilities are 0.9, 0.05, 0.05.

13
00:00:39,594 --> 00:00:42,740
If I compute the expected value of that variable x,

14
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,289
it's going to be equal to 0.15.

15
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:47,750
What that means is really unclear.

16
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,929
But imagine our sample spaces actually a numeric quantity,

17
00:00:50,929 --> 00:00:54,990
such as the number of GPS satellites that a flying car can detect.

18
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,435
Our random variable looks like this,

19
00:00:57,435 --> 00:01:00,280
with the number of satellites and probability.

20
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,094
If we compute the expected value over this random variable,

21
00:01:04,094 --> 00:01:09,355
then you have the expected value of x is equal to the sum of p of x of i,

22
00:01:09,355 --> 00:01:13,380
times x of i, which is going to be equal to 0.1 times one,

23
00:01:13,379 --> 00:01:15,560
plus 0.1 times two, and so on.

24
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,700
That's going to be equal to three point 3.5,

25
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,670
and it tells us something about the number of satellites that we might

26
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:38,650
expect to see at any given time.
