1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,950
In the control module,

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,139
we assume we know the position,

3
00:00:04,139 --> 00:00:08,309
velocity, orientation, and rotation rate of the vehicle.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,669
If you look back to our 3D control diagram,

5
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:16,589
you can see how some of these quantities they use in the various control loops.

6
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:19,094
The role pitch controller for example,

7
00:00:19,094 --> 00:00:22,149
relied on knowledge of the vehicle altitude,

8
00:00:22,149 --> 00:00:26,584
and the body rate controller relied on knowledge of the body rates.

9
00:00:26,585 --> 00:00:29,414
But where do these quantities come from?

10
00:00:29,414 --> 00:00:31,339
As you'll see in this lesson,

11
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:34,155
they must be either measured directly,

12
00:00:34,155 --> 00:00:37,079
or calculated from measured quantities.

13
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,170
To make these measurements, we need sensors.

14
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,980
Quadrotors are gripped with multiple complimentary sensors,

15
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:47,069
and the sensors that you'll find on the quadrotor

16
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,105
are often the same sensors you'll find in your smartphone.

17
00:00:51,104 --> 00:00:54,959
So for example, my phone has cameras,

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,594
it has a GPS sensor,

19
00:00:56,594 --> 00:01:01,244
accelerometers, magnetometers, gyroscopes, pressure sensors,

20
00:01:01,244 --> 00:01:03,504
and even temperature sensors.

21
00:01:03,505 --> 00:01:06,975
And all of these sensors are used in drones.

22
00:01:06,974 --> 00:01:10,424
So, if you added four motors to your phone,

23
00:01:10,424 --> 00:01:12,569
it would be able to fly.

24
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:16,979
In fact, the development of small and affordable sensors for

25
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:21,689
smartphones really helped open the door for better and low cost drones.

26
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:26,230
So let's quickly go over each of these sensors.

27
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:28,840
First, we have gyroscopes.

28
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,520
Gyroscopes measure rotational rates of the vehicle in

29
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:38,754
the body frame and they update at a very high rate usually at a few kilohertz.

30
00:01:38,754 --> 00:01:41,604
Next, we have accelerometers.

31
00:01:41,605 --> 00:01:45,299
And these actually don't measure acceleration directly,

32
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:48,644
but measure something called specific acceleration,

33
00:01:48,644 --> 00:01:51,045
which we'll talk about more later.

34
00:01:51,045 --> 00:01:55,519
These also operate at a very high rate up to a few kilohertz.

35
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,890
Then, we have a magnetometer or compass,

36
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,965
which gives us orientation in inertial frame

37
00:02:01,965 --> 00:02:06,030
using the magnetic field of the Earth at about 100 hertz.

38
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,259
The GPS is a very important sensor for outdoor flight,

39
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:14,084
and it measures not only position, but also velocity,

40
00:02:14,085 --> 00:02:18,840
and it does so at low rates;10 hertz is a standard sensor these days.

41
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,955
Then we have the barometer,

42
00:02:20,955 --> 00:02:23,550
which measures air pressure to infer

43
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:27,960
altitude which is a direction that is not as accurate in.

44
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,770
And the barometer operates at about a 100 hertz.

45
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:36,390
There are more sensors that could eventually go on a flying vehicle,

46
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:38,429
but these are really essential.

47
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,510
The challenging part is correctly using all of the sensors to

48
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:47,359
measure or infer the 12 state variables of a flying vehicle.
