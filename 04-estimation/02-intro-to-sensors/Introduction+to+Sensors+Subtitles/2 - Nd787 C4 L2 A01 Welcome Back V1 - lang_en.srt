00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,745
Welcome back, and welcome back Angela.

2
00:00:02,745 --> 00:00:04,724
Thanks it's great to be here.

3
00:00:04,724 --> 00:00:08,129
As you can tell this course is going to be jointly taught by Nick,

4
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,095
Angela and in the next lesson,

5
00:00:10,095 --> 00:00:11,880
you'll need a third instructor Stephanie.

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,850
So, what are we going to learn in this lesson Angela?

7
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:18,509
This lesson is all about sensors and how a flying vehicle

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,695
uses imperfect but complimentary sensors like accelerometers,

9
00:00:22,695 --> 00:00:27,045
rate gyros and GPS to accurately estimate where it is in the rock.

10
00:00:27,045 --> 00:00:29,010
Right. Because up until now,

11
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,950
it's been pretty easy to forget about sensors when you're working in

12
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,210
a simulated environment where you just assume perfect knowledge of your vehicle.

13
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,859
That's right, but then you start working on real flying vehicles,

14
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:44,320
you are going to find that sensors are impossible to ignore.
