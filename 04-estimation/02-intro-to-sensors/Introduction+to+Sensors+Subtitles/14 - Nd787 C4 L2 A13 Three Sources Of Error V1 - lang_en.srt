00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
A typical sensor model looks like this,

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,125
and this says that the measured value of a sensor

3
00:00:07,125 --> 00:00:11,099
comes from some bias plus this term here,

4
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:15,989
which is the identity matrix plus the scaling and cross-coupling matrix,

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,600
M. And that's multiplied by

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,975
the true value X and then there's always this additive component of random noise.

7
00:00:24,975 --> 00:00:28,840
So these three terms, b, M,

8
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:32,814
and eta are the three primary sources of error.

9
00:00:32,814 --> 00:00:35,469
First, there's the bias,

10
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:40,729
and you've seen that bias is just an offset in a measurement value.

11
00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:45,549
And usually, we model bias as a random walk where the bias at

12
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:50,724
time t is equal to the bias at t minus one plus random noise.

13
00:00:50,725 --> 00:00:55,370
And here, you can see some typical biases plotted over time.

14
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:57,039
And as you can see,

15
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,710
there's no real upwards or downwards pattern to these biases,

16
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,500
but they do generally tend to move away from zero.

17
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,584
Then, there's the scaling and cross-coupling matrix.

18
00:01:08,584 --> 00:01:10,449
And if this is zero,

19
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,674
then we only have bias and noise.

20
00:01:12,674 --> 00:01:14,500
But if it is non-zero,

21
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,540
then the diagonal terms indicate that there's a slope error.

22
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,700
So instead of measuring one,

23
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,070
I measure 1.1, and instead of measuring two, I measure 2.2.

24
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:29,984
The off-diagonal terms indicates some coupling.

25
00:01:29,984 --> 00:01:32,950
So if this were a three-axis accelerometer,

26
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:38,909
this could indicate that the X accelerometer is actually influencing the Y accelerometer,

27
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,149
for example, or it might indicate that

28
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,955
there some misalignment between the sensor and the vehicle body coordinate frames.

29
00:01:47,954 --> 00:01:50,969
Finally, there's also random noise,

30
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:53,353
and the key word here is random,

31
00:01:53,353 --> 00:01:58,004
which means there's no correlation between past and future values.

32
00:01:58,004 --> 00:02:03,879
And usually, this is assumed to be a zero mean Gaussian with some covariance sigma.
