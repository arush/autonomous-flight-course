1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,495
The number that you read from a gyroscope is

2
00:00:03,495 --> 00:00:07,390
unlikely to be the correct value of the rotation rate.

3
00:00:07,389 --> 00:00:11,609
In order to make sense of their imperfect measurements that we receive

4
00:00:11,609 --> 00:00:16,269
from a sensor we first need a measurement model for that sensor.

5
00:00:16,269 --> 00:00:21,899
Once we have the measurement model we can use the measurements we'll receive to estimate

6
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:27,564
the body rate of the vehicle and then we can integrate to get the actual altitude.

7
00:00:27,565 --> 00:00:32,700
A simple measurement model for a gyroscope looks like this.

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,950
Here we see that the measured value of the rotation rate omega is equal to

9
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,090
the true angular velocity which gets corrupted

10
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,980
by some kind of bias that we may need to identify ahead of time.

11
00:00:46,979 --> 00:00:51,449
Plus some additive zero mean Gaussian noise.

12
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:56,250
So, here the noise is something that changes for every measurement we get.

13
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,219
The bias might be temperature dependent,

14
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:01,109
and might change slowly,

15
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,900
but it's something that stays constant at least for some amount of time.

16
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,800
Now, I'd like to use this measurement to track my angle theta,

17
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,144
and also my uncertainty from time step to time step.

18
00:01:14,144 --> 00:01:19,199
And we can use this army got tilda measurement to update an angle from

19
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,010
time t minus 1 to t and the equation we use looks like this.

20
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:28,109
And it's important to note that this is

21
00:01:28,109 --> 00:01:31,200
a discrete approximation for computing the integral.

22
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,490
So, really there would also be some epsilon approximation error.

23
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:38,864
But we're going to ignore that for now.

24
00:01:38,864 --> 00:01:42,545
We are also going to assume that any potential bias is

25
00:01:42,545 --> 00:01:45,950
calibrated and removed from the Gyro measurements.

26
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,240
So, our make up tilda just looks like this.

27
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:53,609
And clearly, for this equation to be useful at time step t,

28
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:57,510
I would have needed to start with some initial angle theta not,

29
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:01,900
and then repeated this update with all my measurements up until now.

30
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:07,380
This type of navigation-by-integration is called dead reckoning.

31
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:10,379
Inertial navigation that is navigation based on

32
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:14,514
inertial sensors only is purely based on dead reckoning.

33
00:02:14,514 --> 00:02:16,679
And as you might have guessed,

34
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,159
it's highly susceptible to drift.
