1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,899
When we know the attitude of the vehicle we can use

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:08,830
the accelerometer measurements as measurements of the vehicle's acceleration.

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:13,800
But even if we only have an estimate of the vehicle's attitude we can still

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:19,094
use this estimate to convert accelerometer measurements into accelerations.

5
00:00:19,094 --> 00:00:23,460
And luckily, we have a way to estimate the vehicle's attitude.

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,210
We can use the gyroscopes that we discussed earlier.

7
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:33,079
And this is the key idea behind what's called 3D inertial navigation.

8
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:35,739
First, we will use measurements from

9
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:40,100
the rate gyros to do dead-reckoning on the orientation.

10
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:44,340
And second, we will use the accelerometer measurements

11
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,420
to do dead-reckoning on the accelerations to get precision.

12
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,929
And each of these steps will be susceptible to drift

13
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:56,325
since each of these steps requires at least one integration.

14
00:00:56,325 --> 00:01:01,380
And because of this, the arrows are going to grow with time which means

15
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:06,480
inertial navigation isn't a great approach to estimation on it's own.

16
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:13,575
But inertial navigation is a great complement to a position fixing navigation system like

17
00:01:13,575 --> 00:01:17,150
GPS which has a low update rate but provides

18
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:22,330
drift-free corrections to the estimate you get from inertial navigation.

19
00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:28,759
There's a good human analogy for both inertial navigation and position fixing.

20
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,460
Let's start with inertial navigation.

21
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:35,299
Right now, take a look around wherever you are sitting,

22
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:38,659
so that you've localized yourself in your environment.

23
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:41,420
Now, don't actually try this,

24
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,195
but I want you to imagine closing your eyes

25
00:01:44,194 --> 00:01:47,753
and trying to navigate around this environment.

26
00:01:47,754 --> 00:01:52,685
Initially, you'd have a very good estimate of value val.

27
00:01:52,685 --> 00:01:56,475
But every time you took a step or turned,

28
00:01:56,474 --> 00:01:58,919
you'd be able to update your belief,

29
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,549
but your uncertainty would grow just a bit.

30
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:06,899
This is analogous to pure inertial navigation.

31
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:12,780
And if you tried to only use inertial navigation as you wandered around an environment,

32
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,169
then eventually you're uncertainty would grow too

33
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:21,054
high and you would be lost and possibly run into a wall.

34
00:02:21,055 --> 00:02:24,460
Now, imagine the rules changed a bit.

35
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:29,405
Imagine every five steps you were allowed to open your eyes.

36
00:02:29,405 --> 00:02:34,939
This is similar to the position fixing you would get from a GPS measurement.

37
00:02:34,939 --> 00:02:40,509
Because every time you open your eyes you would essentially use the new information

38
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:42,519
to correct the uncertainty you had

39
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,420
accumulated during the eyes-closed inertial navigation.

40
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:51,714
This example shows how slow but drift-free GPS measurements

41
00:02:51,715 --> 00:02:57,759
can complement the faster but drift prone measurements you get from an IMU.
