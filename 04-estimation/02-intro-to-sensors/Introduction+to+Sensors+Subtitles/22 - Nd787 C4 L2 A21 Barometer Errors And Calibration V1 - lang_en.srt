1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,660
So, a barometer lets you measure your height with respect to some reference height,

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,734
and there are a few ways to get this reference.

3
00:00:08,734 --> 00:00:11,414
For example, there are reference stations at

4
00:00:11,414 --> 00:00:14,804
every airport which report this pressure and temperature,

5
00:00:14,804 --> 00:00:17,554
and airplanes can navigate on that,

6
00:00:17,554 --> 00:00:20,304
but however you get this reference,

7
00:00:20,304 --> 00:00:23,984
the important thing to know is that we can only measure

8
00:00:23,984 --> 00:00:28,655
altitude change by measuring pressure difference.

9
00:00:28,655 --> 00:00:32,200
So, what are the sources of error for a barometer?

10
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,890
First, we have the resolution of the barometer.

11
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:41,070
Barometers can generally measure with about a 10 Pascal resolution,

12
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,909
and that corresponds to about one meter of altitude difference near the sea level,

13
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:51,229
and three meters if you are 10 kilometers above sea level.

14
00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:54,569
Next, barometers are slow sensors.

15
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,520
It takes some time for the air to get in and deform the plates,

16
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,760
so they tend to lag during fast climbs.

17
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,019
There are also interesting sources of noise that we have to deal with.

18
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:10,459
Turbulence, wind, and propeller downwash are all concerns,

19
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:15,079
but by far the biggest source of error comes from differences between

20
00:01:15,079 --> 00:01:20,795
the true and modeled atmospheric temperature and pressure at the reference location.

21
00:01:20,795 --> 00:01:23,730
Both of which can vary over time,

22
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:30,340
so calibrating a barometer basically involves estimating these parameters Ts and Ps,

23
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,810
and to do the estimation,

24
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,150
we have a couple of options.

25
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:38,105
Ideally, we have access to some reference station which

26
00:01:38,105 --> 00:01:42,079
gives us regular updates about the surface pressure and temperature,

27
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,140
which they can use to avoid large drifts.

28
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,849
Another option is to do online estimation of Ts and

29
00:01:48,849 --> 00:01:53,879
Ps if we have an additional drift-free height sensor like GPS.

30
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:56,159
And when we do online estimation,

31
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,004
we typically model Ts and Ps as random walks.

32
00:02:00,004 --> 00:02:04,265
Something interesting about this is that in an ideal world,

33
00:02:04,265 --> 00:02:08,509
a plane can actually use its barometer and GPS to

34
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:13,479
estimate the temperature and air pressure at the airport where it took off.
