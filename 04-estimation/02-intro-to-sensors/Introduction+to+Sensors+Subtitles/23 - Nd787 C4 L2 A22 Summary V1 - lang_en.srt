00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,750
We've talked about several sensors in this lesson,

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:09,629
and the sensors we've discussed are likely to show up on just about any flying vehicle.

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,795
They are all relatively small, low-cost,

4
00:00:12,794 --> 00:00:16,605
and ultimately really useful for state estimation.

5
00:00:16,605 --> 00:00:19,500
When we use these sensors together,

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,925
we can get really accurate estimates of our vehicle state.

7
00:00:23,925 --> 00:00:26,039
For example, we can fuse

8
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,335
the fast but drift-prone measurements that we get from an accelerometer,

9
00:00:31,335 --> 00:00:34,774
with the slower but drift-free measurements we get from

10
00:00:34,774 --> 00:00:39,920
GPS to make really accurate estimates about the vehicle's position.

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,310
But I don't want you to leave this lesson thinking

12
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,914
the sensor problem is solved, it is not.

13
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:52,670
For example, flying car companies are currently struggling with questions like,

14
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:57,125
how can we safely and consistently land an autonomous vehicle?

15
00:00:57,125 --> 00:01:02,060
Or how can we do what's called the see and avoid flight?

16
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:06,269
And this is something that has to be solved before we can

17
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:10,984
substantially increase the density of flying vehicles in the air.

18
00:01:10,984 --> 00:01:14,310
It's not at all clear what the solution to

19
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,375
these problems will be or even what sensors will be involved,

20
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:23,609
but likely, they will require sensors that we haven't even discussed in this lesson,

21
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:27,334
like stereo cameras, lidar, and radar.

22
00:01:27,334 --> 00:01:30,534
So, when you start working in this field,

23
00:01:30,534 --> 00:01:33,959
be prepared to analyze the pros and cons of

24
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:40,000
the latest sensors as you choose which is the best for your particular vehicle design.
