1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,360
In addition to giving us direct measurements of position,

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,115
GPS also gives us direct measurements of velocity.

3
00:00:08,115 --> 00:00:12,780
I want to emphasize that these measurements really are direct.

4
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:18,484
They don't come from differentiation of two subsequent position measurements.

5
00:00:18,484 --> 00:00:22,500
Instead, the velocity measurements we get from GPS

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,509
come from the Doppler shift of the received carrier frequencies.

7
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:29,860
I'm not going to talk about the Doppler effect here,

8
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:34,825
but I do want to mention just how accurate these measurements are.

9
00:00:34,825 --> 00:00:37,440
In the horizontal x, y plane,

10
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:43,424
the velocity measurements have an accuracy of about 2-5 centimeters per second.

11
00:00:43,424 --> 00:00:49,799
In the vertical direction the accuracies are within about 4-10 centimeters per second.

12
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,439
That's really pretty accurate.

13
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:56,729
It's really useful as a complement to accelerometers.

14
00:00:56,729 --> 00:01:00,899
The position measurements that we get from GPS are accurate to

15
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,414
within about 5-10 meters which is also pretty amazing.

16
00:01:05,415 --> 00:01:08,270
But where do these errors come from?

17
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:12,609
One source is atmospheric effects in the ionosphere,

18
00:01:12,609 --> 00:01:16,379
where free electrons interfere with the transmitted signal

19
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:20,674
and corrupt the measurement by changing the signal travel time.

20
00:01:20,674 --> 00:01:23,189
Then there's clock error.

21
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:27,599
If a satellite's clock is off by one nanosecond,

22
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:34,049
that translates into an error in position of about one foot or 30 centimeters.

23
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:37,334
There's also what's called multipath errors.

24
00:01:37,334 --> 00:01:40,500
So, you can imagine if you're standing here,

25
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,299
then there might be some straight line path to a GPS satellite.

26
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:47,834
But there's other routes that the signal could take.

27
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:52,489
It might bounce off of a tall building and then into your receiver,

28
00:01:52,489 --> 00:01:55,489
or it might bounce off the ground.

29
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:58,809
In either case, the measured distance would increase

30
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:04,060
substantially and this could lead to sudden jumps in your measure position.

31
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,609
You can correct for this by comparing

32
00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:10,930
your GPS measurements to your estimate and looking for outliers.

33
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:16,330
If a new GPS measurement is outside of the three sigma bounds of your estimate,

34
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,210
then it's really unlikely to be correct.

35
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,620
There's one last thing to mention;

36
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,254
the process of GPS initialization.

37
00:02:25,254 --> 00:02:30,009
Something you may have noticed when using GPS on your smart phone is that

38
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:35,334
sometimes it can take a while for your phone to get a GPS location fix.

39
00:02:35,335 --> 00:02:38,120
This is also an issue for drones.

40
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,259
When you turn on your drone,

41
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:42,745
you usually want to use it right away,

42
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:46,520
but sometimes we have to wait for the GPS fix.

43
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,409
The reason we have to wait is because it takes some time for

44
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:55,180
a GPS receiver to actually find the signals from the satellites.

45
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,170
That's because the GPS signal strength is pretty weak,

46
00:02:59,169 --> 00:03:05,319
and it takes some clever algorithms and a bit of time to actually identify the signals.
