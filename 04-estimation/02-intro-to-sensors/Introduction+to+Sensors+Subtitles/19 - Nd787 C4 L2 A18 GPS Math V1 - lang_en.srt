1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,290
Trilateration relies on four distance measurements to

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:09,300
calculate the value of four unknown variables: the GPS receivers,

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,960
3D position, as well as its clock error.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,425
When we measure the time of flight from a satellite to

5
00:00:16,425 --> 00:00:20,700
a GPS receiver and then convert this to a distance,

6
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,989
we call the measurement a "pseudorange" measurement.

7
00:00:23,989 --> 00:00:28,500
And the pseudo reflects that we have these clock errors.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,429
Let's talk about what's called the Pseudorange Model.

9
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:36,179
The travel time for a GPS radio signal is

10
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:40,784
just the time of reception minus the time of transmission.

11
00:00:40,784 --> 00:00:46,069
You can multiply that by the speed of light to get a distance Ps.

12
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:51,435
So T in this equation is the receiver clock time at reception,

13
00:00:51,435 --> 00:00:55,920
Ts is the satellite clock time at transmission,

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,635
and c is the speed of light.

15
00:00:58,634 --> 00:01:02,609
But the problem is that we have these clock errors,

16
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:07,980
so I'm actually going to write big T as lowercase t plus tau,

17
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:13,070
and big Ts as lowercase ts plus tau s. The

18
00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:19,594
lowercase t's are the true receive and transmit times and the taus are the clock errors.

19
00:01:19,594 --> 00:01:24,439
So, we can plug these equations into the pseudorange equation.

20
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:27,179
And we can do a little math.

21
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,995
And we see that the pseudorange is now the true range row

22
00:01:31,995 --> 00:01:37,495
plus this other term which is the difference in clock errors times the speed of light.

23
00:01:37,495 --> 00:01:40,850
So, this delta tau is something that we have

24
00:01:40,849 --> 00:01:44,539
to estimate as well as the 3D position of the vehicle.

25
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:49,910
And this row is the true range of the vehicle which we could write like this.

26
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:52,560
And these terms represent the x, y,

27
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,829
and z positions of the satellite at the time of transmission, and these are known.

28
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:01,829
These terms are the x, y,

29
00:02:01,829 --> 00:02:05,609
and z position of the receiver and they are unknown.

30
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:09,824
So, we have one equation here and it has four unknowns,

31
00:02:09,824 --> 00:02:14,054
but we can generalize to multiple satellites like this.

32
00:02:14,055 --> 00:02:21,425
And here, I'm using a notation where p1 is the pseudorange to the first satellite,

33
00:02:21,425 --> 00:02:26,344
x y and z are for the unknown receiver location,

34
00:02:26,344 --> 00:02:29,710
and tau is the receiver's clock error.

35
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:35,575
And we are assuming that the taus for each of the satellite clock errors is known.

36
00:02:35,574 --> 00:02:40,134
So, now we have a system of four equations with four unknowns,

37
00:02:40,134 --> 00:02:43,449
and this is a non-linear least squares problem that you could

38
00:02:43,449 --> 00:02:46,679
solve using the techniques you have learned in the previous lesson
