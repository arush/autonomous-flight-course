1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,615
Why is it important to have multiple sources of measurement?

2
00:00:03,615 --> 00:00:06,450
Because none of them is perfect.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:10,605
Compare the accelerometer to the GPS, for instance.

4
00:00:10,605 --> 00:00:15,750
Each of these sensors can be used to get information about the position of the vehicle.

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,410
The GPS makes position measurements directly,

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,234
and the accelerometer can be integrated to get position.

7
00:00:23,234 --> 00:00:24,890
So the question is,

8
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,335
why do we need both?

9
00:00:26,335 --> 00:00:31,664
One important reason is because different sensors are accurate in different ways.

10
00:00:31,664 --> 00:00:33,869
The accelerometer, for example,

11
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:36,979
gives us a really smooth idea of where are,

12
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:39,164
and that's because accelerometers are

13
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:43,204
constantly running at a really high rate with no drop outs.

14
00:00:43,204 --> 00:00:47,174
So we can integrate those measurements to track our position.

15
00:00:47,174 --> 00:00:49,799
The GPS isn't as smooth.

16
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:52,678
The measurements come at a much lower rate,

17
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:55,094
and they are susceptible to sudden jumps,

18
00:00:55,094 --> 00:00:59,384
which can happen if we lose track of one of the satellites, for example.

19
00:00:59,384 --> 00:01:04,780
We like that the accelerometer is smooth and low noise in the short term.

20
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,390
But it's susceptible to drift errors which grow with time.

21
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,519
So, if we had these measurements here,

22
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,750
the true trajectory might have actually looked something like this.

23
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,125
The GPS, on the other hand,

24
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:22,605
provides an external positional reference which doesn't drift.

25
00:01:22,605 --> 00:01:25,679
So, even so these points are noisy,

26
00:01:25,679 --> 00:01:30,269
they are at least generally centered on the true path of the vehicle,

27
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:36,739
which means we can use GPS measurements to help correct drift from the accelerometer.

28
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:40,799
So, you can see just from this high level view that GPS and

29
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,909
accelerometers can complement each other when measuring position,

30
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:50,144
and this is just one way that sensors can complement each other.

31
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:54,429
Later, you'll see how we can also balance the trade-offs of

32
00:01:54,430 --> 00:02:00,060
accelerometers against gyros to get an accurate estimate of altitude.

33
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,990
The three main goals of this lesson are: one,

34
00:02:03,989 --> 00:02:06,879
combine sensor measurements from different sensors

35
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:09,930
on board a flying vehicle to estimate the vehicle state.

36
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,770
You'll do this by using your knowledge of what these sensors

37
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,925
measure and their accuracy to derive measurement models for estimation,

38
00:02:18,925 --> 00:02:21,160
and that's the second goal.

39
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:24,585
The measurement models that you derive will wind up

40
00:02:24,585 --> 00:02:28,335
being crucial to the overall estimation of vehicle state.

41
00:02:28,335 --> 00:02:32,784
Finally, you will learn how to use sensor calibration and

42
00:02:32,784 --> 00:02:37,444
initialization to improve the quality of the measurements your sensors make.

43
00:02:37,444 --> 00:02:40,169
In the next lesson, you will learn how to use

44
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:43,530
the measurement models that you derive here along with

45
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,304
a model of the vehicle in motion to maintain

46
00:02:46,304 --> 00:02:50,164
a robust and responsive estimate of the vehicle state.

47
00:02:50,164 --> 00:02:52,120
For the rest of this lesson,

48
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:58,175
you're going to go sensor by sensor to learn how each one works and what it measures.

49
00:02:58,175 --> 00:03:03,390
Then we'll discuss how we can model the noise associated with each sensors,

50
00:03:03,389 --> 00:03:05,489
because no sensor is perfect,

51
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,060
and then we'll discuss how we can reduce this noise by

52
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,860
designing the right initialization and calibration routines for each sensor.
