1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Even though accelerometers don't measure the true acceleration of a vehicle,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,609
they are still incredibly useful.

3
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:14,160
I'd like to talk about two measurements that we can make with an accelerometer.

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,410
And for now, I'm going to assume that we are working for the perfect noise free

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,539
accelerometer that's attached directly to the center of mass of a vehicle.

6
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,574
So, what are the two measurements we can make?

7
00:00:28,574 --> 00:00:33,405
First, we can use an accelerometer to measure the vehicles attitude.

8
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:36,570
Now we, can only do that correctly if

9
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:39,509
we assume there's no net force acting on the vehicle,

10
00:00:39,509 --> 00:00:42,750
which means the vehicle isn't accelerating.

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,049
And remember, this is what an accelerometer measures.

12
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:50,445
If we assume that the net force is zero,

13
00:00:50,445 --> 00:00:55,755
then that means that the accelerometer is actually measuring G directly.

14
00:00:55,755 --> 00:01:00,870
So, A sub accel is going to be given by this equation,

15
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:06,734
but the measurements that we receive in the body frame are going to look like this,

16
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:10,920
and this equation just says that the measured components of

17
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,560
the accelerations equal to a rotation matrix times the gravity vector.

18
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,890
When we use ZYX all angles,

19
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,519
we can express the measured components of acceleration as

20
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,959
a function of the roll angle phi and the pitch theta.

21
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:31,515
If you solve these equations for theta and phi,

22
00:01:31,515 --> 00:01:33,135
you get the following;

23
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:39,120
phi is just the inverse tangent of the measured Y over the measured set,

24
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:46,290
and theta is the inverse sign of the measured Y over G. Note that we can't measure

25
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,540
yaw is an accelerometer because

26
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,850
the gravity vector doesn't change when we change the yaw of the vehicle.

27
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:59,549
So, that gives you some idea of how we can measure attitude with an accelerometer.

28
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:06,349
The second thing we can measure with an accelerometer is acceleration*.

29
00:02:06,349 --> 00:02:08,729
Now there's a big asterisk here,

30
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:14,899
because we can only measure the vehicle's acceleration when the body attitude is known.

31
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:18,463
And the reason is because we know the attitude,

32
00:02:18,463 --> 00:02:20,324
we know the rotation matrix.

33
00:02:20,324 --> 00:02:22,514
And when we know the rotation matrix,

34
00:02:22,514 --> 00:02:26,369
we can write the acceleration of the vehicle like this.

35
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,075
And this equation gives the acceleration of the vehicle

36
00:02:30,074 --> 00:02:33,329
in the body frame as the sum of the acceleration from

37
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,600
gravity plus the specific acceleration

38
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,099
from everything else as measured by the accelerometer.

39
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:42,030
And as you'd expect,

40
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,289
this acceleration can be integrated to get velocity in the body frame

41
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:51,584
and that velocity can again be integrated to get position in the body frame.

42
00:02:51,585 --> 00:02:55,310
And whenever we want it to convert back to the old frame,

43
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:59,159
we just have to multiply by the rotation matrix again.
