1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,375
So, let's talk about one implementation of the Bayes filter called the Kalman filter.

2
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:11,925
And we're going to talk about the Kalman filter by using an example of a 1D drone.

3
00:00:11,925 --> 00:00:15,330
And this drone is able to set it's acceleration

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,004
which will influence the vertical velocity and the height, z.

5
00:00:19,004 --> 00:00:22,649
Let's start by defining the state variables for this system.

6
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:24,375
For this 1D drone,

7
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:25,620
when we ignore yaw,

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,115
the state variables are just z dot and z.

9
00:00:29,114 --> 00:00:34,185
Then the control input for this system we can say is just z double dot.

10
00:00:34,185 --> 00:00:37,920
Now, I'm also going to need a state transition function

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,520
which we call g. And this function's job is

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,850
to advance the state x of t to time t plus

13
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,079
one based on the system dynamics and the given control input.

14
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,674
So, the velocity updates like this,

15
00:00:51,674 --> 00:00:53,189
x of t comma,

16
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:55,469
z dot is how I'm going to refer to

17
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:59,729
the z dot component of the state variable at time t. So,

18
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:02,909
this just says that the new velocity is

19
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:08,369
the old velocity plus the control input which is the acceleration times delta t.

20
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:12,525
Then the new position is just the previous position

21
00:01:12,525 --> 00:01:18,105
plus the velocity times delta t. That's one way to write the transition function,

22
00:01:18,105 --> 00:01:22,380
but we could also express this in matrix form like this.

23
00:01:22,379 --> 00:01:26,369
Here, we have one matrix A sub t times

24
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:32,100
the state vector plus another matrix B sub t times the control input.

25
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:33,989
And usually, when you see

26
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:38,384
Kalman filter math you'll see it expressed in this matrix notation.

27
00:01:38,385 --> 00:01:42,195
So, think back to the Bayes filter for a moment.

28
00:01:42,194 --> 00:01:46,769
Remember, we had bel and bel bar that we were passing around.

29
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:49,364
Any of these beliefs could have been anything.

30
00:01:49,364 --> 00:01:55,349
Now, with the Kalman filter we're insisting that beliefs must be Gaussian.

31
00:01:55,349 --> 00:02:00,239
And that means that all we have to pass around is mu and

32
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:05,354
sigma where mu is the mean and sigma is the covariance.

33
00:02:05,355 --> 00:02:08,370
Then we can manipulate this mean and

34
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:13,080
the covariance in the Kalman filters prediction and update steps.
