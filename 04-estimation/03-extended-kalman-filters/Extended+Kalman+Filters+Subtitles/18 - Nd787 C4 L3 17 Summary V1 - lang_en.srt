1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,745
In this lesson, you will learn how to maintain

2
00:00:02,745 --> 00:00:06,419
an accurate and responsive estimate of a vehicle state using

3
00:00:06,419 --> 00:00:08,490
something called a Kalman Filter for

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,335
linear systems or an extended Kalman Filter for non-linear systems.

5
00:00:13,335 --> 00:00:16,289
Both of these algorithms are implementations of

6
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:19,049
a more general algorithm called the Bayes Filter,

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,230
which uses a cycle of motion prediction and

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,945
measurement update steps to maintain a belief of a vehicle state.

9
00:00:26,945 --> 00:00:31,140
The thing that made the KF and EKF special was

10
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,070
the assumption that our beliefs were described by Gaussian's.

11
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,378
With that assumption in place,

12
00:00:37,378 --> 00:00:42,239
the mathematics of the base filter just turned into sequences of Matrix operations.

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,630
The difference between the KF and the EKF had

14
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:49,050
to do with the linearity of our motion and sensor models.

15
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:52,289
So for the one dimensional vertical drone,

16
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:57,359
our motion model and our sensor model were both linear functions of their inputs,

17
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:59,609
and because of that we could solve

18
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:03,524
the estimation problem optimally using a Kalman Filter.

19
00:01:03,524 --> 00:01:09,644
But when we try to use a Kalman Filter on our weird 2D drone we ran into problems.

20
00:01:09,644 --> 00:01:13,769
Both the motion model and the sensor model had non-linear terms in them,

21
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:17,039
which meant we couldn't write them as matrices.

22
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,245
The extended Kalman Filters solves this problem by calculating the Jacobian

23
00:01:22,245 --> 00:01:27,525
of these models to linearize them around the current estimated state of the vehicle.

24
00:01:27,525 --> 00:01:33,060
These linear approximations have to be made at every time stamp and when we do that,

25
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,909
we can treat this system as if it were linear.

26
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:37,579
In the next lesson,

27
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:41,474
we'll take the idea of state estimation into three dimensions,

28
00:01:41,474 --> 00:01:44,579
and also learn about another variant of

29
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:48,319
the Kalman Filter called the unscented Kalman Filter.
