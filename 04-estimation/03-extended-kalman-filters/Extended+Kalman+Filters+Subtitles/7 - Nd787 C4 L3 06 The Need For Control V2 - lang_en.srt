1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,149
So, with this exponential moving average,

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:04,934
we have to make this trade-off.

3
00:00:04,934 --> 00:00:07,589
If we make alpha close to one,

4
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:13,125
then we trust our previous estimate much more than any new observation,

5
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:15,870
and this leads to an estimate that's pretty

6
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:19,285
robust against really bad measurements which we like,

7
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:23,219
and that leads to pretty smooth estimates of state,

8
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:26,649
which is good if the drone state actually is smooth.

9
00:00:26,649 --> 00:00:29,644
But when the drone starts moving,

10
00:00:29,644 --> 00:00:32,429
this breaks down and the estimate is slow to

11
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:36,854
respond to new measurements from the drone's new position.

12
00:00:36,854 --> 00:00:41,309
So, large alpha is robust, but not responsive.

13
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:46,355
So, we can make alpha small and choose to believe our new measurements.

14
00:00:46,354 --> 00:00:47,889
And with this approach,

15
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:53,594
we will see that changes in the drone state get quickly incorporated in the estimate,

16
00:00:53,594 --> 00:00:59,069
but the estimate is really susceptible to getting tricked by bad measurements.

17
00:00:59,069 --> 00:01:03,480
So, small alpha is responsive, but not robust.

18
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,609
Now, what I want is to have my cake and eat it, too,

19
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:10,578
I want an estimate that's fast and responsive,

20
00:01:10,578 --> 00:01:14,704
but also still robust against bad sensor measurements.

21
00:01:14,704 --> 00:01:17,359
And the way that we can achieve this is by

22
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,715
using something very general called a Bayes' Filter,

23
00:01:20,715 --> 00:01:27,140
and the basic idea of the Bayes' Filter is that we're going to incorporate control input,

24
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,950
what I told the drone to do,

25
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:32,605
and sensor input, what I measured about the world.

26
00:01:32,605 --> 00:01:35,780
And we're going to do this in the mathematically correct way

27
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:39,920
according to how we've defined our model of the system.
