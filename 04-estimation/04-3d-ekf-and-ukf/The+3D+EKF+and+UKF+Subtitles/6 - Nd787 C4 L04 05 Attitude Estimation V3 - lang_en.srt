00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,129
As I said before,

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:06,375
we're going to be using something called a complimentary filter for attitude estimation.

3
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:09,615
So, we might as well get that out of the way first.

4
00:00:09,615 --> 00:00:13,949
For a real quadrotor to fly in three-dimensions,

5
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:18,524
it's crucial that it have a really accurate estimate of it's attitude.

6
00:00:18,524 --> 00:00:22,348
Small mistakes in roll and pitch estimates especially,

7
00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:25,109
can lead to some really bad behaviour.

8
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:27,179
The basic idea behind

9
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:32,144
a complimentary filter is that we're going to use two measurements of attitude.

10
00:00:32,145 --> 00:00:36,195
One, which comes from the accelerometer and a second,

11
00:00:36,195 --> 00:00:38,630
which comes from the rate gyros.

12
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,515
Neither of these measurements alone can provide

13
00:00:41,515 --> 00:00:44,375
a reliable and responsive attitude estimate.

14
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:48,289
But taken together, the two sensors compliment each other,

15
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:51,475
and we can get a good estimate of attitude.

16
00:00:51,475 --> 00:00:56,015
The accelerometer measures attitude because it can tell you which way is down,

17
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:57,899
and that's because of gravity,

18
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,375
which we know always points down.

19
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:04,829
Then if the drone feels an acceleration vector which is inclined,

20
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:06,010
there's a good chance,

21
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,579
that means the drone itself isn't level.

22
00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:12,109
We can use this to figure out the roll and the pitch.

23
00:01:12,109 --> 00:01:14,390
Now, there are some caveats here,

24
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:19,969
but the key idea is that when we average the acceleration over long time scales,

25
00:01:19,969 --> 00:01:21,289
It should point down,

26
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,300
and we can use that reference down to measure attitude.

27
00:01:25,299 --> 00:01:30,659
Unfortunately, any individual accelerometer measurement is pretty noisy.

28
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,109
So, over long time scales,

29
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:35,179
the accelerometer is good,

30
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,485
but it's not very responsive to sudden changes in attitude.

31
00:01:39,484 --> 00:01:42,019
The rate gyros on the other hand,

32
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:45,450
give really good measurement of the angular rates,

33
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,954
and these can be integrated to get the attitude.

34
00:01:47,954 --> 00:01:50,280
These measurements aren't very noisy.

35
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,840
But since they get integrated they are susceptible to a drift over time.

36
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,064
So, this means the rate gyros are responsive,

37
00:01:58,064 --> 00:02:01,590
but they aren't useful over long time scales.

38
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,405
So, we have accelerometer measurements that are good over long time scales,

39
00:02:06,405 --> 00:02:11,115
and gyro measurements that are good over short time scales.

40
00:02:11,115 --> 00:02:15,480
We want to combine these measurements intelligently so that we can have

41
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:20,399
an estimate of attitude that is both accurate and responsive.
