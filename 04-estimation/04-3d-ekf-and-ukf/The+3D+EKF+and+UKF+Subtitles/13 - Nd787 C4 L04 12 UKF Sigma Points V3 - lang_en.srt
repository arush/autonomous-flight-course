1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,125
So, how do we get these special Sigma points?

2
00:00:04,125 --> 00:00:08,339
We can't just symmetrically sample any points around the mean.

3
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:12,019
In order for the math underlying the UKF to work out,

4
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:14,744
we need to choose the right points.

5
00:00:14,744 --> 00:00:18,559
In fact, if we have an N dimensional state space,

6
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:23,250
we're going to need to generate two times N plus one Sigma points.

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,990
The first Sigma point is just going to come from the mean.

8
00:00:26,989 --> 00:00:29,429
If I were doing this in one dimension,

9
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,534
that would mean my first Sigma point is here.

10
00:00:32,534 --> 00:00:36,794
Then my remaining two points might be at the mean plus

11
00:00:36,795 --> 00:00:41,684
the standard deviation and the mean minus the standard deviation.

12
00:00:41,683 --> 00:00:45,244
To calculate Sigma points in higher dimensions,

13
00:00:45,244 --> 00:00:47,669
I first need to calculate S,

14
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,940
which is the square root of the covariance matrix.

15
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:54,549
Remember, this will be an N by N matrix.

16
00:00:54,549 --> 00:00:57,849
So, this S matrix will have N rows.

17
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:02,085
I'm going to refer to row number I as S_i.

18
00:01:02,085 --> 00:01:04,170
You can think of this like

19
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,390
a multidimensional version of a standard deviation in one dimension.

20
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:12,724
Now that I have S with rows given by S_i.

21
00:01:12,724 --> 00:01:16,719
I'm going to get my Sigma points according to this math here.

22
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,329
This just says, I should take my first point to be

23
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:24,715
the mean and then I should sample N points like this,

24
00:01:24,715 --> 00:01:29,365
where each point is sampled by stepping some distance away from the mean.

25
00:01:29,364 --> 00:01:32,809
The size of that step is set by Gamma and

26
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,620
the direction is given by row I of the S matrix.

27
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:39,965
Of course, I also have to do something similar

28
00:01:39,965 --> 00:01:43,240
in the opposite direction to make the sampling symmetric.

29
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:48,875
Eventually, we're going to use all of these Sigmas to try to recover the mean

30
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,530
and covariance of the samples once we

31
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,864
pass them through the measurement and transition models.

32
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:57,114
When we perform that averaging,

33
00:01:57,114 --> 00:02:00,619
we aren't going to count all of the Sigma points equally.

34
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:07,150
Each one will have a weight we use for the mean calculation given by these equations.

35
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:12,319
Note here, the superscript N to denote that this weight is used for

36
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,009
the mean calculation and each Sigma point will

37
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:20,784
also have a separate weight associated with the covariance calculation.

38
00:02:20,784 --> 00:02:23,349
We'll explain more about the details of

39
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:27,969
this math and some other parameters in the text below this video.
