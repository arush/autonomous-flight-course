1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,650
Let's walk through the math that underlies the complimentary filter.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,699
We assume the state acts that were tracking is the

3
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:12,794
vehicles pitch and roll angles: theta and phi.

4
00:00:12,794 --> 00:00:16,820
We also assume that these angles stay close to zero.

5
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,800
The linear complimentary filter that we will implement will

6
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,240
not perform well when these angles stray far from zero,

7
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:25,079
though it's possible to adapt

8
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:29,684
a non-linear complimentary filter in a way that allows it to work for any attitude.

9
00:00:29,684 --> 00:00:32,979
So, the measurements come as a measurement of

10
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:36,879
theta and phi from the accelerometer and a measurement of

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,679
theta-dot phi-dot from the gyros and these measurements come

12
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,570
with some frequency and we can denote the time between sensor measurements as T_S.

13
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:51,945
So, now we want to come up with an estimate for theta and

14
00:00:51,945 --> 00:00:58,869
phi based on this measurement z sub t and the previous estimate at time t minus one.

15
00:00:58,869 --> 00:01:02,659
To do that for theta we use the following algorithm.

16
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:07,954
Here, tau is a time constant and T_S is the filter sampling period.

17
00:01:07,954 --> 00:01:13,450
Then this equation says that my new estimate is going to be equal to some coefficient,

18
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:22,260
tau over tau plus T_S and all of that times the old estimate plus theta-dot times T_S.

19
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:27,640
This multiplication of theta-dot times T_S is just an integration.

20
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,120
So, basically in this first term,

21
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,810
we're taking the old estimate and we're adding the change from the gyros.

22
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,769
And this measurement isn't very noisy,

23
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:39,839
but since we're performing an integration,

24
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,005
this estimate is susceptible to drift.

25
00:01:43,004 --> 00:01:45,834
Then we have the second term.

26
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:50,239
And this is just this coefficient T_S over tau plus

27
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:55,019
T_S times the direct measurement that we get from the accelerometer.

28
00:01:55,019 --> 00:02:00,840
And this is a much noisier estimate but it won't be susceptible to drift.

29
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,380
And the idea is that we're going to put a low-pass filter on

30
00:02:05,379 --> 00:02:09,879
the noisy estimate and a high pass filter on the other estimate,

31
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:14,694
and this allows us to get the benefits of both approaches by using these two filters.

32
00:02:14,694 --> 00:02:20,169
And note that this coefficient and this coefficient together sum to one.

33
00:02:20,169 --> 00:02:25,794
So, we can tweak the behavior of the estimator by adjusting this time constant tau.

34
00:02:25,794 --> 00:02:29,439
But in general this first coefficient will be big,

35
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:36,159
maybe 0.95 and this other coefficient will be smaller closer to 0.05.
