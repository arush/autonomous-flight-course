1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,730
Now that we've got prediction figured out,

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,060
we can move on to the measurement update step.

3
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:11,189
And this is going to require defining a measurement model h,

4
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:15,884
and then finding the jacobian h prime for each of our sensors.

5
00:00:15,884 --> 00:00:18,285
So, let's go through our sensors.

6
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:20,640
We can start with GPS.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,484
We get position and velocity from the GPS.

8
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:30,289
So, this z_t is the measurement you'd get.

9
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:34,204
And since we're directly measuring all of these state variables,

10
00:00:34,204 --> 00:00:37,039
the measurement model is really straightforward,

11
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:40,754
and this means the jacobian looks like this.

12
00:00:40,755 --> 00:00:44,525
The other sensor is the magnetometer.

13
00:00:44,524 --> 00:00:48,619
And this gives us a measurement of the yaw angle psi.

14
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:51,784
Again the observation model is straightforward.

15
00:00:51,784 --> 00:00:53,914
We just measure psi directly.

16
00:00:53,914 --> 00:00:57,045
And the jacobian looks like this.

17
00:00:57,045 --> 00:01:02,090
And these two sensors are all that you'll need to handle in the final project.

18
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:06,030
And since it turns out that everything is linear for these sensors,

19
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,105
the update step is especially straightforward.

20
00:01:09,105 --> 00:01:12,314
But not all drones have GPS.

21
00:01:12,314 --> 00:01:15,359
Some drones like the crazyfly for example,

22
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:20,519
use a camera and something called optical flow to measure the velocity of the vehicle.

23
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:24,179
The math for optical flow involves a lot of geometry,

24
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,960
but Nick is going to teach you more about that in the last lesson.

25
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:31,079
At this point you should have everything you need to

26
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:34,760
implement the update step for the 3D EKF.
