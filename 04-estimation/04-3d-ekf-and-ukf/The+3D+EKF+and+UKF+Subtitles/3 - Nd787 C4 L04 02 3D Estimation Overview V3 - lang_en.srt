1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,790
At this point, I want to outline at

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:06,120
a high level what our overall strategy is going to be.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,089
The first thing to point out is that we're not going to

4
00:00:09,089 --> 00:00:12,419
estimate the entire state using an EKF.

5
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:15,990
We're only going to be using an EKF to estimate x,

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,969
y, z, there derivatives and their angle psi.

7
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:23,875
To estimate the body rates p, q,

8
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:27,704
and r we just use the direct measurements from the rate gyros.

9
00:00:27,704 --> 00:00:32,414
To estimate the roll and pitch angles which are referred to as the attitude,

10
00:00:32,414 --> 00:00:35,054
we're going to use another type of filter called

11
00:00:35,054 --> 00:00:38,715
a complimentary filter which you'll learn more about shortly.

12
00:00:38,715 --> 00:00:41,910
For now, I want to say a few more things about

13
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:45,344
the EKF portion of the estimator that you'll be implementing.

14
00:00:45,344 --> 00:00:48,975
So, remember the EKF algorithm from last lesson.

15
00:00:48,975 --> 00:00:52,560
Something that's pretty cool is that you're going to be using a lot of

16
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:58,065
the same code that you wrote in the last lesson for the EKF in the 3D case.

17
00:00:58,064 --> 00:01:00,074
None of this is going to change,

18
00:01:00,075 --> 00:01:04,215
except the G and g prime of the state transition model,

19
00:01:04,215 --> 00:01:07,695
the H and h prime of the measurement model,

20
00:01:07,694 --> 00:01:11,629
and these constants of the measurement and transition co-variance.

21
00:01:11,629 --> 00:01:14,789
All the rest is exactly identical.

22
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,035
This is something that's really nice about these filters.

23
00:01:18,034 --> 00:01:20,269
In many ways, the problem doesn't really

24
00:01:20,269 --> 00:01:23,274
change conceptually when you move from one dimension,

25
00:01:23,275 --> 00:01:25,240
to two, to three.

26
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:30,079
Unfortunately, there are a few things that do get pretty complicated in 3D.

27
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,649
First is that the state vectors are larger,

28
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:36,200
and what that means is that these Jacobians,

29
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,030
this g prime and h prime get big, especially g prime.

30
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:45,320
We're only going to be estimating seven state variables with our EKF.

31
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:50,254
But that still means our Jacobian g prime will be a 7 by 7 matrix.

32
00:01:50,254 --> 00:01:53,314
Forty nine entries is a lot to keep track of.

33
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:56,599
Fortunately, most of the entries are zero,

34
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:00,274
but it's still a non-trivial thing to make it all work together.

35
00:02:00,275 --> 00:02:05,155
The second complication is that there are a lot of sensors to deal with.

36
00:02:05,155 --> 00:02:07,890
Instead of a single range sensor,

37
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,164
now we're going to have a GPS,

38
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:12,844
an I MU, a magnetometer,

39
00:02:12,844 --> 00:02:17,314
and barometer and we might also have a camera or other sensors,

40
00:02:17,314 --> 00:02:21,379
and every single one of those sensors needs a measurement model.

41
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:24,525
The third complication is the transforms.

42
00:02:24,525 --> 00:02:27,550
As you've probably experienced in the controls course,

43
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:31,045
the math just gets harder when we have to work in three-dimensions

44
00:02:31,044 --> 00:02:35,059
and deal with transformations between the world and body frames.

45
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,050
In fact, one of the reasons why we decided to

46
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:41,260
handle attitude estimation in a separate filter,

47
00:02:41,259 --> 00:02:43,584
was to avoid some of the difficulty

48
00:02:43,585 --> 00:02:47,360
associated with these three dimensional transformations.
