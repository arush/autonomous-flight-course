1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
Just like all the other base filters,

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,910
the UKF has a predict and an update stop.

3
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:11,929
We're not going to do the full derivation of the UKF predict and update stops,

4
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:15,279
but it's worth walking through the steps at a high level.

5
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:17,349
Let's start with predict.

6
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,945
This is really just a couple of lines of pseudocode.

7
00:00:20,945 --> 00:00:24,579
First, we convert the mean and covariance into

8
00:00:24,579 --> 00:00:28,914
a set of sigma points which we're calling X of t minus one,

9
00:00:28,914 --> 00:00:33,100
then we propagate each of these Sigma points forward in

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,550
time using our state-transition function g. Which leaves

11
00:00:37,549 --> 00:00:41,054
us with transformed sigma points X_t

12
00:00:41,054 --> 00:00:46,570
and these sigma points are what we return from the predict step.

13
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:52,145
Zooming out, it's helpful to just look at the inputs and outputs of the step.

14
00:00:52,145 --> 00:00:56,015
As was the case with the KF and the EKF,

15
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:59,585
the UKF predict step takes as input a mean,

16
00:00:59,585 --> 00:01:02,625
a covariance, and a controller input.

17
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:06,239
But unlike the KF and the EKF,

18
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,849
the UKF does not return an updated mean and covariance.

19
00:01:10,849 --> 00:01:14,314
Instead, it returns this set of Sigma points.

20
00:01:14,314 --> 00:01:16,969
Later during the measurement update,

21
00:01:16,969 --> 00:01:22,069
will be able to convert these Sigma points into an updated mean and covariance.

22
00:01:22,069 --> 00:01:27,819
The equation we use to recover the mean from the Sigma points looks like this,

23
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:31,684
and this is just a weighted average of each of the points.

24
00:01:31,685 --> 00:01:35,120
The W_i is the weight of point i,

25
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,920
X_i is the actual point.

26
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,594
To get the updated covariance,

27
00:01:40,594 --> 00:01:42,730
we'll use this equation.

28
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:47,355
This X minus mean times X minus mean transpose,

29
00:01:47,355 --> 00:01:50,760
that's just how you calculate the sample covariance,

30
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,840
and that's going to be weighted by each samples weight.
