00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
Michael did a great job in his interview,

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,519
actually he did a really good job of kind of highlighting the problem,

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:08,414
explaining the problem, and taking me through it step-by-step.

4
00:00:08,414 --> 00:00:13,169
I even asked him a couple of questions in his process of going through this problem,

5
00:00:13,169 --> 00:00:15,500
and that allowed him to kind of stop and explain that,

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,905
and kind of break his train of thought.

7
00:00:16,905 --> 00:00:20,670
Things I like to see is if somebody can actually go through and explain something

8
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,320
when they have their thought broken because

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,570
sometimes people might try to rehearse something,

10
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:26,260
and not really understand it very well.

11
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,460
But it really showed that Michael had really good knowledge in the area,

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,825
and understood where he could go to make improvements.

13
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:34,899
Michael also showed a great depth of knowledge in the area,

14
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:37,405
and seemed to be really interested in what he was talking about.

15
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:41,160
I think he did a really good job explaining the Convolutional Neural Net,

16
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:44,559
and explaining how the encoding and decoding works.

17
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,230
It was really great to see how

18
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:49,199
all this passion and excitement come through during his interview.
