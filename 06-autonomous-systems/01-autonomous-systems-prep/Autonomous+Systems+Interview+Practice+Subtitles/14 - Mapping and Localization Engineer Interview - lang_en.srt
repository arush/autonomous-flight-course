00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,140
Hey, welcome here today Mike.

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,750
I'm really glad to have you in here for the interview.

3
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:06,660
What I'd really like to get started with is

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,589
just a question around mapping and localization. Are you ready?

5
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:10,064
Sure.

6
00:00:10,064 --> 00:00:13,799
Okay, great. So, my first question for you is to just describe

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,609
the process behind how satellites determine the position of an object.

8
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:20,394
Sure. So, satellites typically float around in geosynchronous orbit,

9
00:00:20,394 --> 00:00:21,870
and when they're in that orbit,

10
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,420
the Earth is actually spinning and they're actually broadcasting the signal back down.

11
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,945
Then, depending on where you are on Earth,

12
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,460
you have some sort of a GPS packing,

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,420
your GPS picks up the signals from the satellites and then translate

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,210
that to a coordinate or location system using latitude and longitude.

15
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,390
Great. Is that usually something

16
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,520
that just takes one satellite or do you need multiple satellites to determine this?

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,920
So, you can do it with one satellite.

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,270
The problem with one satellite is the area is usually really large,

19
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,080
so you typically want anywhere between three to five satellites

20
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:53,799
on average to actually get a much more accurate position.

21
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:57,409
Interesting. Do you think that's something you can use for like

22
00:00:57,409 --> 00:01:02,609
a robotics application or is that more for autonomous vehicles as well,

23
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:04,049
or is that not accurate enough?

24
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:07,480
I think you can use it to some extent depending on how accurate you need to be.

25
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,200
In terms of something like a self-driving car maybe,

26
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,549
it's just probably not the best.

27
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:13,129
I think you're only accurate within

28
00:01:13,129 --> 00:01:16,769
a couple of feet so typically around plus or minus seven feet or so.

29
00:01:16,769 --> 00:01:20,424
In that case, you could actually be predicted to be in the different lane.

30
00:01:20,424 --> 00:01:23,149
So, that's actually very dangerous in something like a self-driving car.

31
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,170
But if I'm flying a UAV or something like that out in the middle of a field,

32
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,995
that might be good enough for the purpose that I'm in.

33
00:01:29,995 --> 00:01:32,570
Great. Can you think of any approaches that

34
00:01:32,569 --> 00:01:35,399
might be more accurate in a robotics approach?

35
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,430
So, I think what you could do is you can actually take some of

36
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,200
this GPS signal information and you can

37
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,060
actually couple it with some different types of algorithm,

38
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,890
some sort of localization algorithm something

39
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,439
like a particle filter or maybe a common filter.

40
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,194
Have you ever implemented something like a particle filter or common filter?

41
00:01:49,194 --> 00:01:51,375
Yeah. So, I've done both actually.

42
00:01:51,375 --> 00:01:54,090
What did you have to do in order to implement those or

43
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,909
what about them makes them better than just GPS?

44
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,959
Yeah. So, one of the things that you do is there's typically two phases.

45
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:02,739
So, there's usually a measurement phase and then there's an update phase.

46
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:05,629
So, with the measurement phase, you're actually gathering the information that

47
00:02:05,629 --> 00:02:07,099
you've collected from the satellite

48
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:08,739
and making a prediction as to where you're going to move.

49
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,060
Then in your update phase,

50
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,800
you're looking at where your new location is in the measurement information.

51
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,730
Again, adjusting for an error and then kind of going back and fine tuning,

52
00:02:16,729 --> 00:02:18,769
so you're basically making a closed feedback loop.

53
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:22,080
Great. Okay. I think that covers most of what I had for this question.

54
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,765
So, let's go ahead and move on to the next topic.

55
00:02:23,764 --> 00:02:24,434
Great. Thanks.

56
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,039
All right.
