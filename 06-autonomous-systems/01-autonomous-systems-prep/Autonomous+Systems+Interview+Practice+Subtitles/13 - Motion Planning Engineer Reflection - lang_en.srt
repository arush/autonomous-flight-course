Aaron had a great answer on motion planning.

2
00:00:02,565 --> 00:00:05,640
He went through and went from very basic steps and slowly

3
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:09,089
advanced up from a single car driving on the highway by itself,

4
00:00:09,089 --> 00:00:10,859
to adding an additional vehicles,

5
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:12,629
and then having even the crosswalk,

6
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,710
which was in my original question of how to go through.

7
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:20,820
That really showed he was indicating from a very base case to the more advanced case,

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,160
how he would build out a more complex environment for his motion planning.

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,405
He also went into model predictive control,

10
00:00:29,405 --> 00:00:30,745
which I thought was interesting,

11
00:00:30,745 --> 00:00:32,380
and when I asked him about that,

12
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,340
it showed that he really had experience above and beyond what I would

13
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,510
probably expect for people coming into the company at that point.

14
00:00:38,509 --> 00:00:40,140
So, for those reasons,

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,799
I thought it was a great answer.
