1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
All right. Now that we've covered some of the basics

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,280
of interviewing for autonomous systems rules,

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,355
let's get started on watching interviews.

4
00:00:07,355 --> 00:00:09,955
Remember, over the next few videos,

5
00:00:09,955 --> 00:00:12,495
you'll watch various candidates for different roles

6
00:00:12,494 --> 00:00:15,554
approach a problem given to them by their interviewers.

7
00:00:15,554 --> 00:00:19,859
For each candidate considered taking notes on how they approach the problem,

8
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:24,074
what they could do well or can improve on and anything else you find important.

9
00:00:24,074 --> 00:00:27,714
After each video, you'll have a chance to reflect on their performance.

10
00:00:27,714 --> 00:00:32,604
Really try to put yourself in the interviewer's shoes as to how the candidate performed.

11
00:00:32,604 --> 00:00:36,538
If you were the hiring manager or a teammate for someone hiring in this role,

12
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:38,880
is this someone you trust to be capable and

13
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,775
competent in performing the job responsibilities?

14
00:00:41,774 --> 00:00:45,445
Not every one of these candidates will have a perfect response.

15
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:47,744
After you've gotten a chance to reflect,

16
00:00:47,744 --> 00:00:50,789
you'll hear from the interviewer themselves as well.

17
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:53,765
Make sure to compare their thoughts against your own.

18
00:00:53,765 --> 00:00:56,359
I'll see you again after the interviews.
