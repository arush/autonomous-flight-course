1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,745
There's one area we should circle back on,

2
00:00:02,745 --> 00:00:04,765
learning about the company itself.

3
00:00:04,764 --> 00:00:07,080
It's extremely important to research

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,949
the company you're interviewing with before your interview.

5
00:00:09,949 --> 00:00:11,704
As we mentioned before,

6
00:00:11,705 --> 00:00:14,910
you'll likely get asked about why you want to work for the company,

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,940
but you are also likely to get asked about what you know about the company's products,

8
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:22,990
especially in the area you would be working in.

9
00:00:22,989 --> 00:00:24,974
Near the end of the interview,

10
00:00:24,975 --> 00:00:27,630
you could also utilize the information you've researched,

11
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:30,119
they'll come up with detailed questions for the interviewer

12
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,925
themselves in order to avoid asking generic questions.

13
00:00:33,924 --> 00:00:37,519
Let's take a quick look back in the job posting from before.

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,220
One of the first things to know about how a company

15
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:43,304
describes itself is in its commitment to community.

16
00:00:43,304 --> 00:00:45,530
This would indicate to me that I should check out

17
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,005
some of their community initiatives they do.

18
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:52,484
The next paragraph discusses more about their focus on transportation.

19
00:00:52,484 --> 00:00:57,304
Note that this is broader than the most common area they're known for in ride-sharing.

20
00:00:57,304 --> 00:01:00,259
Know who they consider themselves competitors with.

21
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:03,589
Realizing that they are about mobility and transportation as

22
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:07,835
a whole means there is a wide range of companies they see as competitors,

23
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,169
as opposed to what you might expect.

24
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,555
This is not included in the job description,

25
00:01:12,555 --> 00:01:14,415
but while this course was being developed,

26
00:01:14,415 --> 00:01:15,770
Lyft had recently acquired

27
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:19,719
a bike-sharing company and had announced plans around scooter-sharing as well.

28
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:24,224
That was fairly easy to gather from some research of press releases, news,

29
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,199
and blog posts, but it's important way to show that

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,640
you're knowledgeable about and care about the company.
