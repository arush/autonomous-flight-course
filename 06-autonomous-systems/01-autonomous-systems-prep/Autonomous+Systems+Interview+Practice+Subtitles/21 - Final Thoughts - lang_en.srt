1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,009
Now, it's your turn.

2
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:05,400
You're going to get the chance to practice some additional questions yourself.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,155
They're similar to those you may be asked in an autonomous systems interview.

4
00:00:09,154 --> 00:00:13,384
Well, you split out the questions in a different job areas like the interviews were.

5
00:00:13,384 --> 00:00:16,019
While for the project, you only need to focus on

6
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:20,199
a specific area as well as discuss one of your own projects you've worked on.

7
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:22,204
Feel free to check out some of the questions in

8
00:00:22,204 --> 00:00:24,979
other sections on your own traditional practice.

9
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,355
Please remember that this list is not meant to be exhaustive.

10
00:00:28,355 --> 00:00:30,830
There are many, many more potential questions in

11
00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:33,945
these areas that you could be asked during your interview.

12
00:00:33,945 --> 00:00:37,369
However, just like the interviews you watched before,

13
00:00:37,369 --> 00:00:39,559
these are meant to be generally indicative of

14
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,075
the type and style of questions might be asked.

15
00:00:43,075 --> 00:00:46,910
As such, the questions are meant to help you think through how you

16
00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:51,024
would approach questions of this style and practice, how to do so.

17
00:00:51,024 --> 00:00:52,699
In answering these questions,

18
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,790
make sure to add any code, drawings,

19
00:00:54,789 --> 00:00:57,619
or diagrams you feel are necessary to explain yourself.

20
00:00:57,619 --> 00:01:02,044
For the project, any code you write should be done in C++.

21
00:01:02,045 --> 00:01:04,025
While you go through your questions,

22
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:06,185
there is one additional item to consider.

23
00:01:06,185 --> 00:01:11,015
You likely have not finished a topic just by answering the first question asked to be.

24
00:01:11,015 --> 00:01:12,650
After your initial answer,

25
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:16,055
your interviewer will likely follow-up on different items you mentioned,

26
00:01:16,055 --> 00:01:21,100
as well as probe deeper to see just how far your knowledge on a particular topic goes.

27
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:24,199
As such, you should build this into your responses in

28
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,195
your project as you answer what do you think some of the likely follow-ups are,

29
00:01:29,194 --> 00:01:33,319
how might you even go deeper than the initial question required.

30
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:35,649
You may run into things you don't know.

31
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,115
If you're unfamiliar with the question in your area,

32
00:01:38,114 --> 00:01:40,254
go read up and learn about the topic.

33
00:01:40,254 --> 00:01:43,849
It's okay if you don't know every single item in here,

34
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:46,500
and it's fine to make part of this course a learning experience in

35
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,855
your area of interest as well as interview preparation.

36
00:01:49,855 --> 00:01:52,305
We encourage you to challenge yourself here.

37
00:01:52,305 --> 00:01:55,325
Don't just stick to questions you feel you can easily answer.

38
00:01:55,325 --> 00:02:00,055
You might even find a couple of items you want to work on to add to your portfolio.

39
00:02:00,055 --> 00:02:03,650
After the project, we hope you feel much more confident about

40
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:07,600
answering these types of questions and interviewing for autonomous systems positions.

41
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:10,060
Good luck in your job search.
