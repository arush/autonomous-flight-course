1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,549
Overall, I thought Mike did fairly well.

2
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:05,699
He went through and told me about how satellites work correctly,

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,919
and also ascertain that you would need more than

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,789
just a single satellite to be able to localize position correctly.

5
00:00:11,789 --> 00:00:15,269
He also was right in knowing that in robotics applications,

6
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:17,100
especially for a self-driving car,

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,960
the amount of distance that GPS is accurate to is not always sufficient.

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,835
He also was very helpful in coming up with correct applications that you could use in

9
00:00:26,835 --> 00:00:29,355
robotics or self-driving cars such a particle filter

10
00:00:29,355 --> 00:00:32,160
and the fact that he had worked on this before,

11
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,649
that show me that he would be a good fit for this position.

12
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:36,539
One thing I would say that he could do is

13
00:00:36,539 --> 00:00:39,700
perhaps diagram this out for me a little bit more clearly,

14
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,040
but other than that, I thought he gave a sufficient answer.
