1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,334
In the last lesson,

2
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:03,839
you learned about vehicle dynamics by studying

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,484
the effect of forces and torques on a bi-rotor.

4
00:00:07,485 --> 00:00:11,190
And this gave you some impressive predictive power.

5
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:15,929
Given the state of the vehicle and the rotational rates of the two rotors,

6
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:19,035
you could increment the state forward in time

7
00:00:19,035 --> 00:00:22,920
to predict the trajectory of the vehicle in the future.

8
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,595
Then, at the end of the lesson, you went the other way.

9
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:29,477
Starting with a desire trajectory,

10
00:00:29,478 --> 00:00:31,875
like vertical oscillations for example,

11
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:35,744
you were able to determine what sequence of rotor commands would

12
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:40,274
actually cause the bi-rotor to fly in that trajectory.

13
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:42,659
And if we lived in a perfect world,

14
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:45,929
a model of the vehicle dynamics would be all we need.

15
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:48,899
It will tell us how to design vehicle inputs,

16
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,445
the motor turn rates,

17
00:00:50,445 --> 00:00:52,605
that result in a desired motion,

18
00:00:52,604 --> 00:00:55,384
and the vehicle controls problem would be solved.

19
00:00:55,384 --> 00:00:56,844
In the real world,

20
00:00:56,844 --> 00:01:01,698
the control problem is all about managing the messiness of the real world,

21
00:01:01,698 --> 00:01:06,534
and making sure the vehicle achieves the task despite wind disturbances,

22
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:11,244
neglected aerodynamic effects and model parameter uncertainties.

23
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:16,930
For example, your estimate of the rotational inertia of the vehicle may be slightly off.

24
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,835
In the next exercise,

25
00:01:18,834 --> 00:01:21,219
you'll explore one of the problems that can

26
00:01:21,219 --> 00:01:23,769
arise when our knowledge of the vehicle is off,

27
00:01:23,769 --> 00:01:25,629
by even just a little bit.
