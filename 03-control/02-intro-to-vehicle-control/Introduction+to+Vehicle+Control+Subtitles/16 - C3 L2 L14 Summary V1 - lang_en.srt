00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,850
We began this lesson with

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:07,199
a naive open loop approach to control a monorotor in one dimension.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,359
But this approach had a big problem,

4
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:12,625
a single tiny error in how we modeled

5
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:17,714
the vehicle's mass led to a precision error that grew quickly overtime.

6
00:00:17,714 --> 00:00:22,875
We tried to correct that with a proportional P controller which increased the thrust

7
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:29,204
when the vehicle was too low and decreased the thrust when the vehicle was too high.

8
00:00:29,204 --> 00:00:33,369
This was an improvement but caused the vehicle to oscillate.

9
00:00:33,369 --> 00:00:37,739
So we added a derivative or D term to our controller

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,340
which tried to get the vehicle's actual velocity to match the target.

11
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,430
And this helped a lot.

12
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:47,399
We are able to get rid of the oscillations and

13
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,134
generally stay pretty close to the target trajectory.

14
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:54,824
Then, you also saw how we could parameterize

15
00:00:54,825 --> 00:00:59,520
this PD controller using parameters with real physical meeting.

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,725
At this point, the monorotor was flying quite well.

17
00:01:03,725 --> 00:01:07,320
It just wasn't exactly hitting its target and

18
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:11,459
that was because of an underlying error in our model of the vehicle's mass,

19
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:14,069
which was causing it to hover at an altitude that

20
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:17,104
was close to correct but not quite right.

21
00:01:17,105 --> 00:01:21,520
We corrected this by introducing an integral I term,

22
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:26,774
which accumulated this error and adjusted the control in the opposite direction.

23
00:01:26,775 --> 00:01:30,990
Together, these PI and D terms made

24
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:33,059
a PID controller which could

25
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,140
precisely control the monorotor we built within this lesson.

26
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,000
In the next lesson, you'll see how things change when we move into two-dimensional control.
