1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,125
It turns out, that no matter how you adjust your Kp,

2
00:00:04,125 --> 00:00:06,915
you'll never get rid of these oscillations.

3
00:00:06,915 --> 00:00:10,544
To convince yourself that this is the case,

4
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:15,780
imagine a monorotor hovering exactly at its target altitude.

5
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:17,309
In a perfect world,

6
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:19,244
without any model errors,

7
00:00:19,245 --> 00:00:23,520
a P controller would do a pretty good job keeping the vehicle in place

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,094
by commanding a thrust that is equal to the weight of the vehicle.

9
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:30,449
Now imagine that suddenly,

10
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,439
the target altitude is shifted upwards by one meter.

11
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:36,689
So now, the vehicle is here,

12
00:00:36,689 --> 00:00:39,464
but the target said it's way up here.

13
00:00:39,465 --> 00:00:41,385
What's the controller going to do?

14
00:00:41,384 --> 00:00:45,704
Well, it's going to immediately command a large thrust upwards,

15
00:00:45,704 --> 00:00:49,739
and that means that the vehicle is going to accelerate upwards.

16
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,765
And with a P controller,

17
00:00:51,765 --> 00:00:55,155
as long as the vehicle is below the target z,

18
00:00:55,155 --> 00:01:00,810
then it's going to continue to command a thrust that causes upward acceleration.

19
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:06,210
This means that by the time the vehicle gets to that target z,

20
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:08,983
it will have a substantial adverse velocity,

21
00:01:08,983 --> 00:01:12,030
which will cause it to overshoot the target.

22
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:18,045
When plotted over time,

23
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:22,829
the resulting trajectory will always have the oscillations you've already seen.

24
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:27,390
Another way to think about these oscillations is mathematically.

25
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,010
Our controller commands accelerations in proportion to the error.

26
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:35,160
But this, unfortunately, does not lead to

27
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,420
zero velocity when the vehicle gets to the target location.

28
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,030
Instead, the vehicle gets to the target altitude with some vertical speed,

29
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:50,805
and this causes it to overshoot and it begins a cycle of oscillations.

30
00:01:50,805 --> 00:01:53,550
Instead of a picture like this,

31
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:59,459
we want the trajectory where our vehicle reaches the target value and then stays there.

32
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:03,669
And that means we want a graph that looks something like this.
