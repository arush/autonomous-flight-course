00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,345
The code for a P Controller is pretty simple.

2
00:00:03,345 --> 00:00:06,870
And the output that this control strategy produces is already

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,175
much better than the quadratic error we saw with the open-loop controller,

4
00:00:11,175 --> 00:00:13,110
which would have caused a crash.

5
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:15,554
But it's clearly not perfect.

6
00:00:15,554 --> 00:00:19,425
I want to draw your attention to two problems.

7
00:00:19,425 --> 00:00:24,210
The first and most obvious problem is the oscillating behavior.

8
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,130
The actual z, bounces up and down when it's supposed to be steady.

9
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:32,698
The second problem is the offset.

10
00:00:32,698 --> 00:00:37,530
These oscillations aren't even centered on the target z.

11
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,620
We are going to address both of these problems,

12
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:42,989
but let's start with the oscillations.

13
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,990
At this point, you should spend some time playing

14
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,109
around with different values of this kp constant,

15
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:52,229
that relates error to command thrust.

16
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:56,474
As you do, keep the following question in mind,

17
00:00:56,475 --> 00:00:59,564
why are these oscillations occurring,

18
00:00:59,564 --> 00:01:03,320
and is it possible to get rid of them by tuning kp?
