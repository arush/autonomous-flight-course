1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,819
To correct for systematic bias,

2
00:00:02,819 --> 00:00:05,919
we need a full PID controller.

3
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:08,835
The I, in PID, stands for integral.

4
00:00:08,835 --> 00:00:11,175
And if you remember from calculus,

5
00:00:11,175 --> 00:00:14,860
the integral of a function is the area under the curve.

6
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:20,530
So, when you have an error function that looks like this one, well,

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,500
the integral of this function from let's say,

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,500
0 to 5, would be all of this area.

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:33,700
And the integral from 0 to 10 would also include all of this area as well.

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,205
The integral of an error like this over time,

11
00:00:36,204 --> 00:00:39,570
is a very useful tool for accumulating error.

12
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,225
And that's exactly what the item in the PID controller does.

13
00:00:44,225 --> 00:00:47,325
It accumulates error over time and then

14
00:00:47,325 --> 00:00:51,460
adjusts the system to counter the accumulation of error.

15
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:57,377
Mathematically, we can write the full PID controller equation like this,

16
00:00:57,377 --> 00:01:00,695
or reparameterized, we can write it like this.

17
00:01:00,695 --> 00:01:04,805
With this reparameterization, similar to the PID controller,

18
00:01:04,805 --> 00:01:11,610
we just need to choose a damping ratio between 0.7 and 1 and decide on a time constant,

19
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:15,375
which is directly related to the raised time.

20
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:18,704
This makes the tuning task so much more intuitive

21
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:22,484
compared to tuning these three independent parameters,

22
00:01:22,484 --> 00:01:26,105
Kp, Ki, and Kd.

23
00:01:26,105 --> 00:01:27,630
When we get this right,

24
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:30,729
the altitude will start to look more like this.

25
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,750
As the integrated error accumulates,

26
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,000
the vehicle is able to adjust its thrust until it reaches the target altitude.
