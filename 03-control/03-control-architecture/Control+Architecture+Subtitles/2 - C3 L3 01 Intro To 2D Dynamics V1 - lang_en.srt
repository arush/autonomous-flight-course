00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,984
Welcome back. In the last lesson,

2
00:00:02,984 --> 00:00:05,189
you learned about PID control,

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,589
and how it can be used to control a vehicle

4
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:10,650
that moves purely in the vertical set direction.

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,769
The equation underlying these dynamics look like this.

6
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:18,504
And here, z double dot is the acceleration in the z direction,

7
00:00:18,504 --> 00:00:21,669
and u1 is a total upward thrust control input.

8
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:25,504
And m and g represent mass and gravitational acceleration.

9
00:00:25,504 --> 00:00:27,520
And since m and g are constants,

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,875
they actually aren't that interesting mathematically.

11
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:32,859
So, another way of writing this equation is like this.

12
00:00:32,859 --> 00:00:37,509
Where u1 bar equals g minus u1 over n.

13
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:39,699
And this rewriting of that equation,

14
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:45,490
helps us to remember that we have direct control over z double dot.

15
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:46,960
This lesson is all about solving

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,914
control problems where the dynamics get a bit more complicated.

17
00:00:50,914 --> 00:00:52,814
Recall from lesson one,

18
00:00:52,814 --> 00:00:56,774
the dynamics of a 2D quadrotor moving in the yz plane.

19
00:00:56,774 --> 00:00:59,129
The equations of motion looked like this.

20
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:03,330
And we're going to be dealing with these equations throughout this lesson.

21
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,664
And for now, I want you to focus your attention on this u1 and u2.

22
00:01:07,665 --> 00:01:11,385
These variables represent the total applied thrust from the rotors,

23
00:01:11,385 --> 00:01:14,609
and the total applied torque from the rotors respectively.

24
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:18,170
And they're both quantities which we can control directly.
