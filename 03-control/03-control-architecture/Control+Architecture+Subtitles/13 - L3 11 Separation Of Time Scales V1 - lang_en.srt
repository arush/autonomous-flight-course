Congratulations!

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:07,390
Hopefully at this point you've implemented your first Cascade controller.

3
00:00:07,389 --> 00:00:10,539
I mentioned earlier that we want the outer loop,

4
00:00:10,539 --> 00:00:13,660
in this case the right position loop of a controller to be

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,410
able to rely on the inner loop of the inner controller.

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:22,759
Why? Because the outer loop assumes it can actually command phi.

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:26,020
So, it basically assumes that the phi command is

8
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:29,829
achieved at the time it computes the next target value.

9
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:34,814
What that means is that whenever the outer loop gets executed the inner loop

10
00:00:34,814 --> 00:00:40,079
should have reached whatever rule had been commanded by the outer loop previously.

11
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,924
And in order for that to happen the inner loop

12
00:00:42,924 --> 00:00:46,699
needs to be running on a faster time scale than the outer loop.

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,609
In the next exercise,

14
00:00:48,609 --> 00:00:51,000
you'll explore that idea a little more deeply.
