1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,758
We just incorporated the fact that phi is small,

2
00:00:03,758 --> 00:00:06,179
and we got rid of our sines and cosines,

3
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:09,059
and now our equations look like this.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,910
And what I really like about these equations,

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:15,983
is that the set acceleration depends only on U1,

6
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:19,615
and phi acceleration depends only on U2.

7
00:00:19,614 --> 00:00:23,000
The one thing that's bothering me still,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,750
is this Y term because it contains the product of two variables, U1 and phi.

9
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:34,159
At this point, it helps to remember that near hover U1 will just be

10
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:40,099
equal to MG plus some small deviation delta U1,

11
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,649
which can be positive or negative.

12
00:00:42,649 --> 00:00:46,534
And likewise, when we linearize around hover,

13
00:00:46,534 --> 00:00:50,119
phi will be close to its value at hover.

14
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:55,394
So phi will be zero plus some small deviation delta phi.

15
00:00:55,395 --> 00:01:02,689
Now, if we plug these versions of phi and U1 into the equations for Y double dot,

16
00:01:02,689 --> 00:01:04,299
we find the following.

17
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:07,200
After multiplying out these terms,

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,625
we are left with the equation for Y double dot.

19
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:14,049
The first term is G times delta phi.

20
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:18,189
And remember, we are assuming delta phi is very small,

21
00:01:18,189 --> 00:01:21,340
so this product will be a small number.

22
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:26,530
But the second term has this delta U times delta phi,

23
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:31,445
which is a very small number times another very small number.

24
00:01:31,444 --> 00:01:35,789
And the key insight behind most linearization is this,

25
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,975
the product of a very small number times a very small number,

26
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:45,780
is a tiny number whose value is so small that it can be safely ignored.

27
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,204
And that means, we can just cancel out this last term,

28
00:01:50,204 --> 00:01:53,204
and we are left with the following equation.

29
00:01:53,204 --> 00:01:58,079
And remember, near Hover delta phi and phi are the same thing.

30
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:04,459
So, this equation reduces to the following truly linear equation for Y double dot,

31
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:07,744
Y double dot equals G times phi.

32
00:02:07,745 --> 00:02:12,520
And that gives us the full linearized decoupled dynamics.
