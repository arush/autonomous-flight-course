00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,695
To understand the dynamics that is the motion of a quadrotor,

2
00:00:04,695 --> 00:00:07,940
we need to understand the forces that act on it.

3
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,830
In case it's been a while since you've taken a physics class,

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,645
we are going to do a pretty quick review of the basic physics in this lesson.

5
00:00:15,645 --> 00:00:21,210
A force is just a push or a pull on an object.

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:23,610
In order to support this quadrotor,

7
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,000
my arms are exerting a force upwards,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,890
which is equal in size to the force that gravity exerts downwards.

9
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,035
In flight, a quadrotor is not supported by anyone's arms.

10
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,110
Instead, a quadrotor supports itself with

11
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:43,240
this thrust force generated by its rotors as they spin through the air.

12
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,900
In fact, these two forces, gravity and thrust,

13
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,225
are the only two types of forces that

14
00:00:49,225 --> 00:00:52,150
we will be thinking about or modeling in this course.

15
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:57,760
In reality, there's at least one more force which affects the motion of a quadrotor,

16
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,105
and that is air resistance or drag.

17
00:01:01,105 --> 00:01:07,430
Drag is a friction force caused by the motion of a body through a fluid such as air.

18
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:11,550
For example, the quadrotor experiences a drag force because

19
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:16,065
of the difference in velocity between the vehicle body and the air.

20
00:01:16,065 --> 00:01:20,385
And there's even drag related to each propeller's individual motion.

21
00:01:20,385 --> 00:01:26,220
In practice, we usually treat drag as a disturbance when designing quadrotor controllers,

22
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,150
and don't model it explicitly as the effects are relatively small at

23
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,925
lower vehicle and wind speeds and

24
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:37,004
because it's difficult to identify the correct drag model.

25
00:01:37,004 --> 00:01:39,795
So let's focus on these two forces,

26
00:01:39,795 --> 00:01:42,120
the force from gravity or weight,

27
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,585
and the forces from each of the rotors, thrust.

28
00:01:45,585 --> 00:01:47,205
As is all forces,

29
00:01:47,205 --> 00:01:51,285
the size of these forces is measured in a unit called newton.

30
00:01:51,285 --> 00:01:53,580
Force is a vector,

31
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,415
and that means that when we analyze a force,

32
00:01:56,415 --> 00:01:59,310
we need to know both the size or magnitude of

33
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,450
that force as well as the direction that force points.

34
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:09,810
For gravity, the force always points straight downwards toward the center of the earth.

35
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,870
And the strength of the force is given by M times G where M is

36
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:19,970
the mass of the quadrotor and G is the acceleration due to gravity,

37
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:24,230
which is about 9.81 meters per second square.

38
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,035
This is the rate at which an object will

39
00:02:27,035 --> 00:02:30,545
accelerate downwards when it's dropped here on Earth.

40
00:02:30,545 --> 00:02:34,880
The strengths of the thrust vector depends on the size and

41
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,095
shape of the rotor's plates and on how fast they are spinning.

42
00:02:39,095 --> 00:02:42,500
And the direction of a rotor's thrust vector is

43
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:47,300
always perpendicular to the plane that the rotor is spinning in.

44
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,860
When we control a quadrotor,

45
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:55,150
all we actually get is to control the magnitude of these four thrust vectors.

46
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,929
That's it.

47
00:02:56,929 --> 00:03:01,795
What's really amazing is that by properly controlling the size of these four thrusts,

48
00:03:01,795 --> 00:03:04,930
we can get quadrotors to do amazing things.

49
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:07,548
We can tell it where to go,

50
00:03:07,548 --> 00:03:13,600
how fast to get there and can even commanded it to perform amazing fleets of agility.

51
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,390
The details of how this control

52
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:20,320
works is something you will learn over the course of this lesson,

53
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,930
but the intuition is something you might already have a sense for.
