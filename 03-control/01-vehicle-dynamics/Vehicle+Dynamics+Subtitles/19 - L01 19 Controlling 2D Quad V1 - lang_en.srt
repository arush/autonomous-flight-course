1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,470
At this point, we've actually covered all the underlying physics of

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,910
quadrotor flight or at least the physics that we'll be modeling.

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,080
You've seen how a propeller generates a thrust and

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,480
a yaw inducing reaction moment that are

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,770
both proportional to the square of the rotation rate.

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,855
You've also seen how gravity,

7
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,460
along with these thrusts,

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,810
influenced the translational acceleration of the vehicle.

9
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,260
And you've also seen how these thrusts produce

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,460
torques which can cause the quadrotor to pitch and roll.

11
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:41,513
And really, that's about it for the physics that we really need to consider for now.

12
00:00:41,513 --> 00:00:43,114
Now, it's time to write

13
00:00:43,114 --> 00:00:48,885
the advanced state method for a controlled drone that flies in two dimensions.

14
00:00:48,885 --> 00:00:51,030
Writing this method will require you to put

15
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,935
together everything you've learned in this lesson.

16
00:00:54,935 --> 00:00:57,315
We'll be providing a solution as well,

17
00:00:57,315 --> 00:01:00,000
but try your best to solve this on your own.
