00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,384
So far, we've discussed how a spinning rotor produces thrust and moments.

2
00:00:05,384 --> 00:00:07,574
We've also discussed equilibrium,

3
00:00:07,575 --> 00:00:12,134
where forces and moments all balance each other out and sum to zero.

4
00:00:12,134 --> 00:00:16,379
Now, it's time to talk about what happens when this is not the case.

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,509
Before we get into the math,

6
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:23,700
it's worth thinking about the intuition for what happens when forces do not balance.
