00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,714
At this point, you have some intuitive understanding of how the rotation rates of

2
00:00:05,714 --> 00:00:12,044
four propellers can lead to four quantities that we are actually most interested in.

3
00:00:12,044 --> 00:00:14,714
The collective upwards thrust,

4
00:00:14,714 --> 00:00:17,684
the total moment about the x axis,

5
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,890
which causes the vehicle to roll,

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,410
the total moment about the y axis,

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,725
which causes the vehicle to pitch,

8
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:30,745
and the total reaction moment about the set axis which causes the vehicle to yaw.

9
00:00:30,745 --> 00:00:33,759
When we analyze the dynamics of a vehicle with

10
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:38,335
a side-by-side rotor configuration that moves in two-dimensions,

11
00:00:38,335 --> 00:00:42,609
we only need to consider the first two quantities.

12
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,070
As you'll see in the next segment,

13
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,715
it's possible to write code that directly translates

14
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:53,005
the rotation rates of the two motors into a collective thrust,

15
00:00:53,005 --> 00:00:55,660
and a moment about the x axis.
