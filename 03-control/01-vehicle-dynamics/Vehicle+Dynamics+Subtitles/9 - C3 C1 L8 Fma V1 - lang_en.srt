1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,576
Unbalanced forces cause acceleration.

2
00:00:03,576 --> 00:00:06,930
When an object experiences an unbalanced force,

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,690
it accelerates in the direction of the net force.

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:13,170
So if thrust is bigger than weight,

5
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,775
there will be an upwards acceleration.

6
00:00:15,775 --> 00:00:20,400
A mathematical relationship between force and acceleration is this,

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,610
F equals mass M times acceleration A.

8
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,190
The F in this equation,

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:29,415
is the net force on whatever object we're talking about,

10
00:00:29,415 --> 00:00:33,450
and the acceleration is measured in an inertial frame.

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,990
That is, a reference frame that is not accelerating,

12
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,320
like the world frame introduced earlier.

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,950
In general, F and A are vectors and have magnitude and direction.

14
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:49,105
But these vectors can be analyzed on a pure direction basis.

15
00:00:49,105 --> 00:00:51,849
So, if we look in the vertical direction,

16
00:00:51,849 --> 00:00:57,385
then the set component of force will cause an acceleration in the set direction.

17
00:00:57,385 --> 00:01:01,320
Since acceleration is the second derivative of position,

18
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,330
we can say F sub Z is equal to M times Z double dot.

19
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:12,890
So, if a monorotor with a mass of two kilograms has these forces acting on it,

20
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:19,985
then the net force would be 23.6 minus 19.6, or 4 newtons.

21
00:01:19,985 --> 00:01:25,000
And this would cause an acceleration of two meters per second squared for this vehicle.
