1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,810
Here, we have a vehicle inclined at some angle phi.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,140
And note, when I say it's inclined at some angle,

3
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:11,894
I'm saying that the vehicle is inclined with respect to the world reference frame.

4
00:00:11,894 --> 00:00:15,089
And the reference frame has a z-axis which points

5
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:18,660
downwards and a y-axis that points to the right.

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,600
And that means that the thrust vector makes

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,865
an angle with the vertical axis of the world frame.

8
00:00:25,864 --> 00:00:29,169
Now, we want to decompose this vector into

9
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,420
vertical and horizontal components in

10
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:35,065
the directions of the coordinate axis of our world frame.

11
00:00:35,064 --> 00:00:37,359
That will look like this.

12
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:40,075
Now, since this is a right angle,

13
00:00:40,075 --> 00:00:42,880
we can use the tools of trigonometry to

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,515
solve for the horizontal and the vertical components of the thrust.

15
00:00:47,515 --> 00:00:50,484
The way we do that is by writing out

16
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:55,810
trigonometric relationships and then solving for what we don't know.

17
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:59,679
So, for example, I know that the sine of phi is equal to

18
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:03,795
the opposite side divided by the hypotenuse,

19
00:01:03,795 --> 00:01:09,465
which in this case, it's the horizontal component of force divided by the total force.

20
00:01:09,465 --> 00:01:13,770
We can solve this equation to find that the horizontal component of

21
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:19,655
thrust is just the total thrust times the sine of the angle phi.

22
00:01:19,655 --> 00:01:24,879
We can apply similar reasoning to find that the vertical component of

23
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:29,799
thrust is just the total thrust times the cosine of phi.

24
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:34,479
It's worth noting that we worked exclusively in the world frame here.

25
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,990
And generally, we can figure out this dynamics in

26
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:41,485
two dimension without having to work in the body frame,

27
00:01:41,486 --> 00:01:46,870
which, remember, is the coordinate frame that's fixed to the vehicle body.

28
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,680
When we get to three-dimensional dynamics in the fourth lesson,

29
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,920
that will no longer be the case.
