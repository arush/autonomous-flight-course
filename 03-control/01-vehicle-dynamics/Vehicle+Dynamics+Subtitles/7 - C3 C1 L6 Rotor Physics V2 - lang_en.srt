1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,370
The rotors that spin clockwise,

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:06,209
introduce a counterclockwise moment, and vice versa.

3
00:00:06,209 --> 00:00:11,294
When the clockwise rotors are spinning faster than the counterclockwise ones,

4
00:00:11,294 --> 00:00:16,335
then the counterclockwise moment produced by those clockwise rotors dominates,

5
00:00:16,335 --> 00:00:20,160
and the vehicle will yar in the counterclockwise direction.

6
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,545
But at what rate will it yaw?

7
00:00:22,545 --> 00:00:28,574
What are the magnitudes of the moments and forces that the spinning rotors produce?

8
00:00:28,574 --> 00:00:31,590
We use the lowercase Greek letter, omega,

9
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:34,520
to represent the rotation rate of a rotor,

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,785
and this rate is measured in units of Radians per second.

11
00:00:38,784 --> 00:00:41,214
So, when omega is two pi,

12
00:00:41,215 --> 00:00:44,515
the rotor is doing one rotation per second.

13
00:00:44,515 --> 00:00:49,495
It turns out, that when a rotor spins for the rotation rate of omega,

14
00:00:49,494 --> 00:00:55,824
the thrust produced and the induced moment are both proportional to the omega squared.

15
00:00:55,825 --> 00:00:58,705
The constant of proportionality,

16
00:00:58,704 --> 00:01:01,614
we call k sub f for force,

17
00:01:01,615 --> 00:01:03,895
and k sub m for moment.

18
00:01:03,895 --> 00:01:09,189
The actual value of these constants depends on the size and shape of the plates,

19
00:01:09,189 --> 00:01:11,185
the specific motors used,

20
00:01:11,185 --> 00:01:15,250
as well as the density of the surrounding air they operate in.

21
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,129
In practice, we usually obtain these values empirically.
