00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,598
By the end of this course,

2
00:00:01,598 --> 00:00:03,322
you will understand, in detail,

3
00:00:03,322 --> 00:00:06,169
how to command these force thrust vectors to make a quadrotor

4
00:00:06,169 --> 00:00:09,132
to do all sorts of amazing things.

5
00:00:09,132 --> 00:00:11,934
But before we get into the full three-dimensional case,

6
00:00:11,935 --> 00:00:14,005
it will be helpful to start simple,

7
00:00:14,005 --> 00:00:16,339
and then add complexity.

8
00:00:16,339 --> 00:00:18,384
So with that in mind,

9
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:20,215
let's start very simple.

10
00:00:20,214 --> 00:00:23,410
Instead of thinking how a quadrotor moves,

11
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:27,847
let's first think about how a monorotor hovers.

12
00:00:27,847 --> 00:00:30,487
In this lesson, and some of the lessons that follow,

13
00:00:30,487 --> 00:00:32,670
you'll notice that we occasionally work with

14
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:37,770
different vehicle models to highlight different aspects of the underlying physics.

15
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,288
Sometimes we'll work with a full quadrotor moving in three dimensions,

16
00:00:42,287 --> 00:00:47,919
but other times we will work with a simpler vehicle which moves in fewer dimensions.

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,304
The monorotor, as the name implies,

18
00:00:50,304 --> 00:00:52,104
has only one rotor,

19
00:00:52,104 --> 00:00:55,454
which means there's only one thrust vector to think about.

20
00:00:55,454 --> 00:00:58,173
And when a monorotor is hovering,

21
00:00:58,173 --> 00:01:01,719
it's in a state called translational equilibrium.

22
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:04,959
When an object is in translational equilibrium,

23
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,269
it means it's not experiencing any translational acceleration.

24
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:13,060
A translation is any non-rotational motion.

25
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,805
So, zero translational acceleration,

26
00:01:15,805 --> 00:01:20,479
just means an object isn't accelerating towards the left or right,

27
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:23,489
or up or down, or forward or backward.

28
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:27,875
The only way an object can be in translational equilibrium,

29
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:31,284
is if the net force on the object is zero.

30
00:01:31,284 --> 00:01:37,813
And this means that any upwards force is balanced by an equal downwards force,

31
00:01:37,813 --> 00:01:42,519
and likewise, for right left and forward back forces.

32
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:46,219
If the weight of a hovering monorotor like this one

33
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:50,307
results in a force that is equal to 100 Newtons down,

34
00:01:50,307 --> 00:01:55,000
what can we say about the total thrust provided by its one rotor.
