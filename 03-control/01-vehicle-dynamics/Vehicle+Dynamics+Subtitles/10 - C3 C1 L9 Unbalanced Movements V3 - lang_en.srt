1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,205
Just like how unbalanced forces cause translational acceleration,

2
00:00:05,205 --> 00:00:09,285
unbalanced moments cause rotational acceleration.

3
00:00:09,285 --> 00:00:13,669
And the equation that relates these quantities looks like this,

4
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:18,144
torque is equal to I times alpha.

5
00:00:18,144 --> 00:00:22,085
This is the equation you might see in an introductory physics class.

6
00:00:22,085 --> 00:00:26,089
Here, torque is the net torque around a given axis.

7
00:00:26,089 --> 00:00:29,024
And remember, I'm using the word torque interchangeably with moment.

8
00:00:29,024 --> 00:00:34,527
Alpha is the angular acceleration about the same axis,

9
00:00:34,527 --> 00:00:38,405
so it tells me how fast my rotational speed is changing.

10
00:00:38,405 --> 00:00:42,060
The units for alpha are radians per second squared.

11
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,700
And this I is a little more interesting.

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:47,594
It's a quantity called Moment of Inertia.

13
00:00:47,594 --> 00:00:50,304
And it's a measure of how hard it is to change

14
00:00:50,304 --> 00:00:54,560
an object's rotational velocity about a particular axis.

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,925
Remember that a quadrotor can roll around its x-axis,

16
00:00:58,924 --> 00:01:01,129
pitch around its y-axis,

17
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,254
and yaw around its z-axis.

18
00:01:04,254 --> 00:01:09,739
And in general, the moment of inertia can be different for each of these axes.

19
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:11,030
We will see later,

20
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,855
that to describe the three-dimensional quadrotor motion,

21
00:01:13,855 --> 00:01:17,495
the moment of inertia will be a three by three matrix,

22
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:20,015
and torque and alpha are vectors.

23
00:01:20,015 --> 00:01:22,075
For the purposes of this lesson,

24
00:01:22,075 --> 00:01:25,954
we'll only be thinking about one axis of rotation at a time.

25
00:01:25,954 --> 00:01:27,980
For our monorotor example,

26
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,289
we are only considering yaw about the z-axis,

27
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:33,808
so we only need to pay attention to Iz,

28
00:01:33,808 --> 00:01:36,500
and alpha and the torque are scalar values.

29
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,745
In the world of quadrotor dynamics,

30
00:01:38,745 --> 00:01:42,255
people tended to use the word moment over torque.

31
00:01:42,254 --> 00:01:46,739
And we usually use the Greek letter psi to represent yaw.

32
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:50,954
So, another way to write this torque equation is like this,

33
00:01:50,954 --> 00:01:55,674
Mz is equal to Iz times psi double dot.

34
00:01:55,674 --> 00:01:58,051
And this is just another way of saying,

35
00:01:58,052 --> 00:02:04,020
that a moment about the z-axis will cause an acceleration in the psi coordinate.

36
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:05,780
Now, let's try applying this,

37
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,215
first by answering a few questions,

38
00:02:08,215 --> 00:02:11,469
and then by programming up a more general solution.

39
00:02:11,469 --> 00:02:13,097
In the next few segments,

40
00:02:13,097 --> 00:02:16,670
the vehicle we will be discussing is a co-axial helicopter,

41
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:20,804
which is just a body with two rotors on top of each other.

42
00:02:20,805 --> 00:02:23,580
These rotors both produce upward thrusts,

43
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,000
but they do so by spinning in opposite directions.
