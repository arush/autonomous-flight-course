00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,035
So far, you've written code to update

2
00:00:03,035 --> 00:00:06,410
the state of a vehicle for two different situations.

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:10,970
First, for a controlled copter which moved only in the set direction,

4
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:16,119
and second, for an uncontrolled vehicle free falling in two dimensions.

5
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:17,795
And in both cases,

6
00:00:17,795 --> 00:00:21,265
the forces were only in the vertical direction.

7
00:00:21,265 --> 00:00:25,080
In both situations, you had gravity pointing down,

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,450
and in the first situation,

9
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,665
you also had thrust,

10
00:00:27,665 --> 00:00:31,485
but that always pointed upwards for the 1-D case.

11
00:00:31,485 --> 00:00:35,034
This made it easy to figure out the net force on the vehicle.

12
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:38,300
When the vehicle is allowed to pitch overall,

13
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,771
and actually turn on its rotors,

14
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:44,524
then we have to handle forces at weird angles like this.

15
00:00:44,524 --> 00:00:46,460
In the next two sections,

16
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:51,877
I will show you how you can use trigonometry to decompose forces in two dimensions,

17
00:00:51,877 --> 00:00:56,123
and then I will also show you an equation for calculating torques,

18
00:00:56,123 --> 00:01:00,000
which you will need to use in calculating pitch and roll in a quadrotor.
