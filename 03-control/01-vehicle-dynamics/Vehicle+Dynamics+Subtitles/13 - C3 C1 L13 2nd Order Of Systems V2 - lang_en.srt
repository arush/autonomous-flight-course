1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,970
The function you just worked with is responsible for

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,450
advancing the state of the vehicle by dt seconds.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,460
And for uncontrolled vehicle,

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,145
the only information we need to be able to do that,

5
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:13,160
is the current state of the vehicle,

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:15,720
which is captured in this reference to self,

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,910
and that's pretty amazing.

8
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,413
Now, the important thing I want you to notice about this code,

9
00:00:21,413 --> 00:00:23,010
are these few lines.

10
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,985
Even so, we are working with a very simple system here,

11
00:00:26,984 --> 00:00:28,679
these lines of code capture

12
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:31,739
much more widely useful mathematical strategy for

13
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:35,417
solving these sorts of state update problems.

14
00:00:35,417 --> 00:00:38,259
And that strategy involves three steps.

15
00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:42,429
Step number one, we figure out what the accelerations

16
00:00:42,429 --> 00:00:46,854
and rotational acceleration of the system will be at the current instant.

17
00:00:46,854 --> 00:00:49,944
For a quadrotor whose orders aren't spinning,

18
00:00:49,945 --> 00:00:52,244
the acceleration just comes from gravity,

19
00:00:52,244 --> 00:00:55,494
which is 9.81 meters per second squared.

20
00:00:55,494 --> 00:00:59,320
Step two, we use this acceleration to

21
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,549
update the associated velocities or rates of change.

22
00:01:03,549 --> 00:01:09,340
Step number three, we use the velocity to update the associated position.

23
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,855
Note, how similar step two and three look.

24
00:01:12,855 --> 00:01:16,535
That's because mathematically, we are doing the same thing.

25
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:19,304
We're accumulating change by calculating,

26
00:01:19,305 --> 00:01:23,685
well really we are numerically approximating the integral.

27
00:01:23,685 --> 00:01:27,299
And because we need to integrate twice to figure

28
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,019
out how the acceleration ultimately influences the motion,

29
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:34,394
this is what's known as a second order system,

30
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:36,075
or a double integrator.

31
00:01:36,075 --> 00:01:39,990
Mathematically, the reason this is a second order system,

32
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:43,125
is because the equations that govern how the system

33
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:47,000
evolves with time, includes second derivatives.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,370
And this equation for a vehicle moving in the vertical directions just

35
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:56,305
says that forces directly influenced the second derivative of position.

36
00:01:56,305 --> 00:02:00,763
And since we can generally figure out what the forces will be on the quadrotor,

37
00:02:00,763 --> 00:02:04,135
you can generally figure out what the accelerations will be.

38
00:02:04,135 --> 00:02:08,860
And then it's just a matter of integrating twice to go from acceleration,

39
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,050
to velocity, to position.

40
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:13,090
An important consequence of this,

41
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,150
is that we need to keep track of both the position,

42
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,069
and the velocity of the vehicle.

43
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:20,829
But nothing more, if we want to be able to keep

44
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:24,450
advancing the state of the vehicle forward by dt.
