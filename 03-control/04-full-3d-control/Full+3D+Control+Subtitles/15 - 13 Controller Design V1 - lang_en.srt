1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,845
The roll-pitch controller is

2
00:00:01,845 --> 00:00:05,565
the most mathematically involved controller in this architecture.

3
00:00:05,565 --> 00:00:08,900
We covered it first because we wanted to stay focused

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,470
on the math associated with 3D rotations.

5
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:16,515
But this isn't the first controller you would implement

6
00:00:16,515 --> 00:00:20,795
if you were actually implementing this architecture from scratch.

7
00:00:20,795 --> 00:00:23,520
The sequence you would want to take would be to

8
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,820
implement and tune the inner control loops first.

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,589
Remember, these inner loops generally

10
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:33,420
operate on a faster time scale than the outer loops.

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,530
So if you were just looking at the position controller,

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,545
roll-pitch controller and body-rate controller,

13
00:00:40,545 --> 00:00:45,310
what sequence would you want to implement these controllers in?
