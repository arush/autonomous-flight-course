00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,125
Hopefully, you were able to use this equation along with the moments

2
00:00:04,125 --> 00:00:08,390
and the moment of inertial matrix to calculate omega-dot.

3
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:14,135
You could then perform an integration of this omega-dot to figure out what the new p,

4
00:00:14,134 --> 00:00:15,794
q, r all were.

5
00:00:15,794 --> 00:00:21,960
This is analogous to using the linear accelerations to update the linear velocities,

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,679
and this means that nine of our 12 variables have been updated.

7
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:28,960
We are almost there.

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,280
All that's left is to update our Euler angles phi, theta, and psi.

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,658
Now unfortunately, this is not just a straightforward integration.

10
00:00:39,658 --> 00:00:41,774
As I mentioned earlier, p, q,

11
00:00:41,774 --> 00:00:44,879
r are not the same as phi-dot, theta-dot,

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,790
and psi-dot, so we can't directly integrate

13
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,740
them and we have one last tricky bit of math to do.

14
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,370
We'll link to papers that explore this math in detail,

15
00:00:55,369 --> 00:00:58,149
but the equation we care about is this.

16
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:02,289
And conceptually, what this equation does is relates

17
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:05,340
an instantaneous turn rate in the body frame to

18
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,895
an instantaneous change in the Euler angles.

19
00:01:08,894 --> 00:01:12,354
And note that we are using Euler angles under the hood

20
00:01:12,355 --> 00:01:16,575
because they have a more intuitive interpretation than quaternions.

21
00:01:16,575 --> 00:01:19,760
If you use a different attitude representation,

22
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,040
this above equation would change,

23
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,660
but would essentially do the same thing going from

24
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:30,189
rotation rates in the body frame to turn rates in the build frame.

25
00:01:30,189 --> 00:01:34,079
And once again, you don't need to memorize these equations,

26
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,724
but when you work in this field,

27
00:01:35,724 --> 00:01:37,629
and you see equations like this,

28
00:01:37,629 --> 00:01:39,694
you now know why we need them,

29
00:01:39,694 --> 00:01:42,299
and you should be able to implement them.

30
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,244
It's also important that you remember that these equations exist.

31
00:01:46,245 --> 00:01:49,645
The dynamics of a quadrotor are pretty well understood.

32
00:01:49,644 --> 00:01:54,299
And before you try throwing machine learning or neural networks and control problems,

33
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:57,719
it's usually helpful to first consult the physics.
