1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,339
In 3D, we are going to do the same general sequence of steps to keep track

2
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,769
of the vehicle state but with slight modifications to keep track of rotations.

3
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:14,879
Remember we also call this attitude of the vehicle.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,589
So, to do this,

5
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:20,570
we are going to need to think in two different coordinate systems,

6
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:24,010
something you saw in the Motion Planning Course.

7
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:28,510
The first is the world frame which is fixed in the world and

8
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:32,895
the other one is the body frame and that is attached to the quadrotor.

9
00:00:32,895 --> 00:00:37,045
And as a reminder, when we look at the quad from above,

10
00:00:37,045 --> 00:00:40,399
the body frame x-axis goes from the center of

11
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,054
the vehicle out between the two forward propellers.

12
00:00:44,054 --> 00:00:47,159
The y axis then points to the right and

13
00:00:47,159 --> 00:00:50,959
the z axis goes into the screen which would be down.

14
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,829
And the thing that makes 3D more difficult is keeping track of these two frames.

15
00:00:56,829 --> 00:00:59,479
Especially when we have to do mass inside of

16
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:02,799
the rotating frame and then convert those rotations into

17
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:04,929
Euler angles in the world frame

18
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:09,520
because ultimately we want to control the drone in the world frame.

19
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:14,140
But we get some of our sensor measurements from the IMU which

20
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:18,269
measures turn rates in the body frame and our controls,

21
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:20,450
especially the moments that we command,

22
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:25,140
have a much more intuitive interpretation when we reason in the body frame.

23
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,905
Because of this, we really have no choice but to think

24
00:01:28,905 --> 00:01:33,260
both in the world frame at some times and in the body frame at others.

25
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:38,600
So, let's go through the steps we outlined for 2D and make some additions and changes.
