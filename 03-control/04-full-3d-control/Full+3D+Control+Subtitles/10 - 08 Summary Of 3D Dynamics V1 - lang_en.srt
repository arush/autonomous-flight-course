00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,480
If you were able to implement all of the methods in this section on your own,

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,464
congratulations, because this math wasn't trivial.

3
00:00:09,464 --> 00:00:13,195
If you needed to consult the solutions, that's okay too.

4
00:00:13,195 --> 00:00:15,080
But either way, hopefully,

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,429
you saw that the maths gets more complicated when you transition to three dimensions.

6
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:24,094
This will become easier with experience and practice.

7
00:00:24,094 --> 00:00:25,640
But I want to point out,

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,245
that trying to implement and code an equation that's given to you

9
00:00:29,245 --> 00:00:33,390
in math is something you will have to do when working in this field.

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,954
As you move to different vehicle designs,

11
00:00:35,954 --> 00:00:38,489
or work on different systems within a vehicle,

12
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,750
you'll likely have to acquaint yourself with a new domain by reading

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,219
papers and trying to reimplement something

14
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:48,155
that someone has already described mathematically.

15
00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:51,484
For example, in the second half of the Nanodegree,

16
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:53,990
you'll learn about fixed wing aircraft,

17
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:58,070
and you'll find that while most of the controls concepts still apply,

18
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:01,380
some of the details of the dynamics will change.

19
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,215
So, with this in mind,

20
00:01:03,215 --> 00:01:06,680
as we transition into full three-dimensional control,

21
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,210
we will also be introducing you to some technical papers

22
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:14,299
from the field and asking you to read sections of these papers.
