00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,605
Congratulations!

2
00:00:01,605 --> 00:00:05,165
I hope you enjoyed implementing each of those control loops.

3
00:00:05,165 --> 00:00:07,924
At this point, you may have noticed that

4
00:00:07,924 --> 00:00:11,705
these controllers seem to work with wide range of parameters.

5
00:00:11,705 --> 00:00:14,085
Specifically, you may have noticed that

6
00:00:14,085 --> 00:00:19,230
really aggressive proportional gains always seemed to make the controller perform better.

7
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,949
The reason you may have noticed this has to do with some of

8
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:24,890
the practical considerations we've

9
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,315
ignored in the quadrotor model you've been controlling.

10
00:00:28,315 --> 00:00:33,689
So far, we've been assuming that the rotors can generate infinite thrust,

11
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:36,699
generate upward and downward thrust,

12
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,935
and instantaneously change thrust.

13
00:00:39,935 --> 00:00:42,255
If rotors could really do that,

14
00:00:42,255 --> 00:00:46,355
then any time the quadrotor deviated from the target trajectory,

15
00:00:46,354 --> 00:00:48,559
the vehicle could instantly command

16
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:53,910
whatever massive force of torque was required to immediately correct itself.

17
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:57,589
In reality, all of these assumptions are wrong.

18
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:03,275
In reality, the motors have a minimum and maximum thrust that they can produce.

19
00:01:03,274 --> 00:01:07,084
And the minimum thrust is a small positive number.

20
00:01:07,084 --> 00:01:08,909
What that means is,

21
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:13,359
that the motors on a quad can only generate thrust in one direction.

22
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,030
Additionally, they have a minimum and maximum rate

23
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,280
at which they can change the thrust that they produce.

24
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,379
Parameter tuning becomes much more important

25
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:26,739
when these actuation constraints are taken into account.

26
00:01:26,739 --> 00:01:28,670
In part of the final project,

27
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,840
you will get to work with a vehicle model that isn't quite

28
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,895
as forgiving as the model you have been working with in this lesson.

29
00:01:35,894 --> 00:01:38,254
In fact, in the real world,

30
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:42,339
gains that are too high can actually cause instability.

31
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,409
Be on the lookout for this as you implement the final project.
