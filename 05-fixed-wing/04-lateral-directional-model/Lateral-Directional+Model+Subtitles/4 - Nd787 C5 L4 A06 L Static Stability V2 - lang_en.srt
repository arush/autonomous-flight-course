1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,360
At this point, you've seen some of the unexpected consequences of fixed-wing dynamics.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,900
For example, you've seen how an aircraft needs to

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,660
roll to perform a comfortable, coordinated turn.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,565
You've also seen how appear yawing motion will actually induce roll in an aircraft.

5
00:00:14,564 --> 00:00:17,009
Neither of these are problems for the vehicle,

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,445
but there are real physical phenomena and the autopilot has to be aware of them.

7
00:00:21,445 --> 00:00:23,910
At this point, we're ready to start talking about

8
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,670
the lateral stability of fixed-wing aircraft.

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:32,010
One way to understand stability is by taking the eigenvalues of the linearized dynamics.

10
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,034
This helps us understand what's called the dynamic stability of the aircraft.

11
00:00:36,034 --> 00:00:39,799
We're going to do that shortly but we can also get some intuition by

12
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:44,194
looking directly at the forces and asking questions about those forces.

13
00:00:44,195 --> 00:00:46,395
One question we might ask is,

14
00:00:46,395 --> 00:00:49,850
when this vehicle is flying in a trim state and gets disturbed,

15
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,609
do the forces tend to restore

16
00:00:51,609 --> 00:00:55,304
equilibrium or do they increase the size of the disturbance?

17
00:00:55,304 --> 00:00:57,560
Let's start with roll stability.

18
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,455
We use the capital letters L, M,

19
00:01:00,454 --> 00:01:03,619
and N for the moments about the vehicles body x,

20
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:05,340
y, and z axes.

21
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,500
So, L is the rolling moment.

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,659
This letter L is a bit overloaded since we also use it for the lift force,

23
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:15,319
but it should be clear in context which is being referred to.

24
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:18,274
The equation for the rolling moment has two terms.

25
00:01:18,275 --> 00:01:21,800
One is proportional to the ailerons deflection as you'd expect.

26
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:25,049
The other is proportional to the side slip angle beta.

27
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:28,340
In general, we want to flight trajectories with zero side slip.

28
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,150
That means that the CL beta parameter is really important.

29
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:35,609
We call this parameter the Role Static Stability Derivative.

30
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:39,484
When it's negative, the vehicle will be statically stable in roll.

31
00:01:39,484 --> 00:01:43,650
That means that when the vehicle rolls to any non-zero side slip angle,

32
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:48,185
this term will create a moment that tends to roll the vehicle back to zero side slip.

33
00:01:48,185 --> 00:01:50,780
Next, we can talk about yaw stability.

34
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:53,165
The yawing moment also has two terms.

35
00:01:53,165 --> 00:01:56,865
One proportional to rudder deflection and one proportional to side slip.

36
00:01:56,864 --> 00:01:59,030
This moment tends to restore the vehicle to

37
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:02,120
zero side slip when this coefficient is positive.

38
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,010
This coefficient is sometimes called

39
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:08,585
the Weathercock Stability Derivative because if an aircraft is statically stable in yaw,

40
00:02:08,585 --> 00:02:12,379
it will naturally want to point into the wind like a weather vane.

41
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:14,509
When designing fixed-wing aircraft,

42
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:17,424
a lot of thought goes into the values of these coefficients.

43
00:02:17,425 --> 00:02:21,930
This yaw coefficient is heavily influenced by the design of the tail of the aircraft.

44
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:24,260
The larger the tail and the further off

45
00:02:24,259 --> 00:02:26,599
the tail is of the center of mass of the aircraft,

46
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:29,239
the larger this coefficient will be.
