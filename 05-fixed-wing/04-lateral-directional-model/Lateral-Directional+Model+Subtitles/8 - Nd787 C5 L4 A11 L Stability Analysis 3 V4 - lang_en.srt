1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,459
The final lateral dynamic mode is called the Dutch Roll mode.

2
00:00:03,459 --> 00:00:08,949
This mode corresponds to the only pair of complex eigenvalues from the stability matrix.

3
00:00:08,949 --> 00:00:10,744
To understand this mode,

4
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:15,779
we're once again going to consider the same vehicle from two angles simultaneously.

5
00:00:15,779 --> 00:00:20,949
I'm going to use curved arrows to denote the roll and yaw rates at each point in time.

6
00:00:20,949 --> 00:00:24,829
We're going to start at T equals zero with this vehicle at some roll angle,

7
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:27,000
phi, and zero, your angle.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,824
Then we're going to introduce some yaw rate as a disturbance.

9
00:00:30,824 --> 00:00:35,375
As you saw earlier, this yaw rate will cause a rolling moment on the aircraft.

10
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:36,905
A few moments later,

11
00:00:36,905 --> 00:00:38,965
the vehicle will look like this.

12
00:00:38,965 --> 00:00:41,205
Now it has zero roll angle,

13
00:00:41,204 --> 00:00:45,649
but due to inertia, it still has some non-zero roll rate in this direction.

14
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:49,074
At this point, the vehicle has reached it's maximum angle,

15
00:00:49,075 --> 00:00:50,730
so the yaw rate has gone to zero.

16
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:52,909
A few moments later,

17
00:00:52,909 --> 00:00:57,709
the roll rate from before will have rolled the vehicle to some new maximal roll angle,

18
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,390
and the lower right wing will lead to

19
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:03,615
a yawing moment which will have restored the vehicle to zero yaw.

20
00:01:03,615 --> 00:01:06,859
Finally, inertia will yaw the vehicle to

21
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:10,980
an orientation like this as the vehicle rolls through wings level.

22
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,835
If we were to plot the roll angle versus time,

23
00:01:13,834 --> 00:01:16,184
we can see that it should start high,

24
00:01:16,185 --> 00:01:21,945
go through zero, reach some minimal value and then return.

25
00:01:21,944 --> 00:01:27,079
We could also plot the yaw angle versus time and we get a plot like this.

26
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:29,659
These plots look very similar,

27
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:34,890
except we can see that there is about a quarter cycle or 90 degrees of lag between them.

28
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,540
Now, why is this called Dutch Roll?

29
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,640
The pioneering aeronautical engineer,

30
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,230
Hans Hacker from MIT,

31
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:45,290
coined the term comparing it to a type of skating called the Dutch Roll where

32
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:50,360
skaters skate on the outside of their blades swinging from side to side as they go.
