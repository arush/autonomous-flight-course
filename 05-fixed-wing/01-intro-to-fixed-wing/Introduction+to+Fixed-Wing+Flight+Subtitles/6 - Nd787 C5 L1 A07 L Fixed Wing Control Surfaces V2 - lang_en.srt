00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,430
If you've ever put your hand out the window while driving on a highway,

2
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:07,509
you already have some idea for how control surfaces in a fixed-wing vehicle work.

3
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:09,474
When you angle your hand upwards like this,

4
00:00:09,474 --> 00:00:12,740
you can actually feel a force on your hand which pushes it upwards,

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:15,000
and when you angle your hand downwards,

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,579
you can feel a force which pushes it downwards.

7
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:21,329
Fixed-wing aircraft is typically equipped with three primary types of

8
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:25,875
control surfaces called the ailerons, elevators, and rudder.

9
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:30,750
These surfaces can be actuated by a pilot or an autopilot to control the roll,

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,759
pitch, and yaw of the vehicle.

11
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:34,890
If you look at our fixed wing simulator,

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,359
you can get a sense for how these work and the vertical tail,

13
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:41,375
you have the rudder and this controls the yaw of the vehicle.

14
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:44,149
When the rudder is deflected to the left that introduces

15
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:47,939
a rotational moment on the vehicle that causes it to yaw to the left.

16
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:52,579
The horizontal tail, you can see the elevators which control the pitch of the vehicle.

17
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:54,754
When the elevators are deflected downwards,

18
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:57,475
that causes the vehicle to pitch downwards as well.

19
00:00:57,475 --> 00:00:59,149
At the end of each wing,

20
00:00:59,149 --> 00:01:02,784
you can see the ailerons which control the roll of the vehicle.

21
00:01:02,784 --> 00:01:05,424
The ailerons act anti symmetrically,

22
00:01:05,424 --> 00:01:08,000
which means that when one ailerons deflects upwards,

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,765
the other deflects downwards.

24
00:01:09,765 --> 00:01:12,299
So, to create a positive role,

25
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:14,384
positive around the body x-axis,

26
00:01:14,385 --> 00:01:16,130
the ailerons on the right-wing deflects

27
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:19,405
downwards and the ailerons on the left-wing deflects upwards.

28
00:01:19,405 --> 00:01:21,980
In addition to these primary control surfaces,

29
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,454
some aircraft will have additional control surfaces like flaps,

30
00:01:25,454 --> 00:01:28,424
spoilers, slats, and rubrics.

31
00:01:28,424 --> 00:01:31,105
We're not going to discuss these too much in this module,

32
00:01:31,105 --> 00:01:34,520
but you can read more about these additional control surfaces below.
