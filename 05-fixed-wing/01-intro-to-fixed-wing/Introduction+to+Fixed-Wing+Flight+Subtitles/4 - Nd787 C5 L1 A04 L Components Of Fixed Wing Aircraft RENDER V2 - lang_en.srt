1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,225
let's establish some basic vocabulary,

2
00:00:02,225 --> 00:00:04,859
so we can refer to the pieces of a fixed wing aircraft.

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,380
When we worked with the quadrotor in term one,

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:10,769
we didn't spend a lot of time talking about the various pieces of the quadrotor.

5
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:13,109
It was enough to know that there were four rotors and we

6
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:15,574
can adjust the speed of each rotor to control the aircraft.

7
00:00:15,574 --> 00:00:17,244
When it comes to fixed-wing aircraft,

8
00:00:17,245 --> 00:00:19,740
there are a lot more mechanical pieces that affect

9
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:21,959
the dynamics and if you want to

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,660
write an autopilot to make the aircraft follow a trajectory.

11
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,140
It's important to know what these pieces are and what they do.

12
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,414
So, let's take a look at a fixed wing aircraft.

13
00:00:31,414 --> 00:00:34,280
The biggest part of most vehicles, is the fuselage.

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,215
This is the main body of the aircraft.

15
00:00:36,215 --> 00:00:38,050
Next, are the wings.

16
00:00:38,049 --> 00:00:39,884
The wings have control surfaces in them,

17
00:00:39,884 --> 00:00:41,854
such as ailerons and flaps.

18
00:00:41,854 --> 00:00:44,119
Any movable bidder the aircraft which changes

19
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:47,500
the aerodynamic properties of the aircraft is called a control surface,

20
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,820
and we'll talk about these more in a little bit.

21
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,280
Then you may have more control surfaces in the back.

22
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,060
You may have a horizontal tail with elevators to control pitch,

23
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,414
and you may have a vertical tail with a rudder for yaw stability.

24
00:00:59,414 --> 00:01:04,000
The horizontal tail and the vertical tail together are called the empennage.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,129
Then we have our propulsion system.

26
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:10,229
In this case, the propulsion system is a single propeller at the front of the vehicle.

27
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,270
But you might also have multiple propellers,

28
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:14,354
in which case they would be on the wings.

29
00:01:14,355 --> 00:01:17,000
When we have a single propeller at the front of the vehicle,

30
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,849
we call it attractor and when the propeller is in the back it's called the pusher.

31
00:01:20,849 --> 00:01:22,894
Finally, we have landing gear.

32
00:01:22,894 --> 00:01:26,239
Since this vehicle isn't capable of vertical takeoff and landing,

33
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:28,309
it needs wheels so it can roll along the ground.

34
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,400
If this were an amphibious aircraft,

35
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,300
then these might be pontoons or some combination of wheels and pontoons.

36
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:37,219
There are many other pieces of a fixed wing aircraft,

37
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:40,069
but this is all we really need to know for now.
