00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,390
To understand the motion of a fixed-wing vehicle,

2
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,865
we need to understand how it moves and rotates in all three dimensions.

3
00:00:05,865 --> 00:00:10,929
But a complete 3D analysis of the forces can get very complicated very quickly.

4
00:00:10,929 --> 00:00:12,684
To avoid this complexity,

5
00:00:12,685 --> 00:00:15,225
we often split the four or 3-dimensional analysis

6
00:00:15,224 --> 00:00:17,725
into two separate 2-dimensional problems,

7
00:00:17,725 --> 00:00:20,405
the longitudinal motion and the lateral motion.

8
00:00:20,405 --> 00:00:22,960
When we analyze the longitudinal motion,

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,894
we typically think of a picture like this where we view the vehicle from the side.

10
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:29,449
This is the picture we used in the previous quizzes.

11
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:33,804
It's also the picture we'll be using for the majority of this lesson as well as the next.

12
00:00:33,804 --> 00:00:35,854
When we analyze a lateral motion,

13
00:00:35,854 --> 00:00:39,259
we either look at the plane from above or from behind.

14
00:00:39,259 --> 00:00:43,099
We'll be analyzing lateral dynamics in the lesson after the next lesson.

15
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,929
Each of these pictures is useful for

16
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:47,715
understanding various aspects of the vehicles motion.

17
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:51,500
For example, longitudinal analysis helps us understand how

18
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,729
the aircraft pitch changes over time

19
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:57,750
while lateral analysis helps us understand roll and yaw.
