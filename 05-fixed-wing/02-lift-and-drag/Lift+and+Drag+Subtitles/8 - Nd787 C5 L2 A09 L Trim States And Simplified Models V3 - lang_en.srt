1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,475
At this point, we've developed a mathematical model for lift,

2
00:00:03,475 --> 00:00:05,634
drag and pitching moment.

3
00:00:05,634 --> 00:00:08,809
Each of these models has a coefficient associated with it.

4
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:12,870
It's important to remember that these equations are models of reality,

5
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:14,864
and these models are not perfect.

6
00:00:14,865 --> 00:00:16,230
When we make models,

7
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,600
we want them to be accurate and simple.

8
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,760
Often, we make assumptions that may make

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,375
our model slightly less accurate in order to keep it simple.

10
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,870
For example, in reality,

11
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,390
these forces and moments also depend on a pitch rate of the vehicle,

12
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,429
which we've been representing with Q.

13
00:00:32,429 --> 00:00:35,479
But this contribution is generally small for normal flight,

14
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:37,289
so we've ignored it in these models.

15
00:00:37,289 --> 00:00:40,339
But what is normal flight for a fixed-wing aircraft?

16
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:41,805
With a few exceptions,

17
00:00:41,804 --> 00:00:46,414
fixed-wing vehicles usually operate at or very near some sort of trim state.

18
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:49,000
A trim state is simply an equilibrium state where

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,395
the net force and net moment on the vehicle are zero.

20
00:00:52,395 --> 00:00:55,585
One common trim state is straight and level flight.

21
00:00:55,585 --> 00:00:57,700
This is flight where the vehicles flying in

22
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,730
a straight and level flight path at constant speed.

23
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:03,044
Straight means the vehicle isn't turning,

24
00:01:03,045 --> 00:01:05,905
and level means it stays at constant altitude.

25
00:01:05,905 --> 00:01:08,379
Note that the level in straight and level flight

26
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:10,869
doesn't refer to the orientation of the vehicle,

27
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,875
but to the fact that its altitude isn't changing.

28
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:18,200
Now we'd like to use our models to answer some questions about this trim state.

29
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,700
For example, if I want to fly at a certain velocity,

30
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,640
I might want to know how much thrust should the propulsion system provide?

31
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,219
What angle of attack should I try to fly at?

32
00:01:28,219 --> 00:01:31,025
In general, the answer will not be zero.

33
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:33,390
What elevator deflection angle will I need?

34
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,519
We would like to answer these questions using a model that's

35
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:40,269
as simple as possible without sacrificing too much accuracy.

36
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:44,634
Let's consider the forces acting on an aircraft in straight and level flight.

37
00:01:44,635 --> 00:01:49,570
There's the weight, lift, thrust, and drag.

38
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:51,639
Since this is a trim state,

39
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,265
the forces must balance in a horizontal or vertical direction.

40
00:01:55,265 --> 00:01:57,915
This is fairly straightforward analysis.

41
00:01:57,915 --> 00:01:59,900
The most important thing to remember is that we

42
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,840
need the lift force to match the weight force.

43
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,454
There is a vertical component of thrust that will help match the weight force,

44
00:02:05,454 --> 00:02:08,294
but we won't be pitched by much, so let's ignore that.

45
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,889
For a level flight, that our pitch is the same as our angle of attack,

46
00:02:11,889 --> 00:02:13,704
and that's where lift comes from.

47
00:02:13,705 --> 00:02:17,810
We just need to pitch up enough to make sure our lift matches our weight.

48
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,129
But if we're pitched up, then we'll have a pitching moment too.

49
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:24,155
That will cause the vehicle to start rotating upwards,

50
00:02:24,155 --> 00:02:25,824
increasing our angle of attack,

51
00:02:25,824 --> 00:02:28,929
creating more lift and causing us to gain altitude.

52
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:32,944
To avoid that, we need to counteract the pitching moment with the elevator.

53
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,000
It might seem counter intuitive,

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,764
but in level flight will deflect the elevator downwards,

55
00:02:37,764 --> 00:02:42,024
just enough to counteract the pitching moment of the positive angle of attack.

56
00:02:42,025 --> 00:02:44,840
The elevator will also contribute to the lift,

57
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,020
but near this trim state the elevator deflection will be really small

58
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,960
and the contribution of this term will be negligible compared to the other terms.

59
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,105
That means, for this example,

60
00:02:54,104 --> 00:02:56,544
we can ignore this terms impact on lift.

61
00:02:56,544 --> 00:03:00,739
We'll walk through some of this math in more detail next.
