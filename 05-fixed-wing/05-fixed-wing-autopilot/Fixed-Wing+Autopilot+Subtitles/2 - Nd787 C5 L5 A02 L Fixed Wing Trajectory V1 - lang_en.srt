1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,169
We've spent a lot of time working out the dynamic model of a fixed-wing aircraft,

2
00:00:04,169 --> 00:00:05,879
and we have an understanding of

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:08,824
the different dynamic modes that the vehicle will exhibit.

4
00:00:08,824 --> 00:00:11,729
But how do we actually put all this together to

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,705
get our flying car to follow a particular trajectory?

6
00:00:14,705 --> 00:00:17,489
The dynamics of a fixed-wing vehicle mean,

7
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:20,394
that there are lots of plans that we just can't follow.

8
00:00:20,394 --> 00:00:22,469
The vehicle obviously can't go backwards,

9
00:00:22,469 --> 00:00:24,539
but it also use a stall speed and it has

10
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,250
a maximum bank angle that limits our turning radius to some minimum.

11
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,519
To simplify our planning problem and also simplify the control problem,

12
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,070
we're going to define a set of trim states that we can be

13
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,740
in and the goal of the autopilot is to move us from

14
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,310
trim state to trim state and keep us in

15
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:44,105
those trim states when the vehicle is perturbed by things like wind gusts.

16
00:00:44,104 --> 00:00:48,484
These trim states are generally straight-line paths or curved orbits.

17
00:00:48,484 --> 00:00:50,875
By restricting our trajectory to these states,

18
00:00:50,875 --> 00:00:52,700
we're basically restricting ourselves to

19
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:56,690
either longitudinal dynamic modes or we're in level flight climbing or

20
00:00:56,689 --> 00:00:59,659
descending or lateral directional flight where

21
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:03,129
we're doing a coordinated turn in one direction or another.

22
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,040
Can the vehicle do more things than that?

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,660
Of course, but more sophisticated maneuvers are a lot

24
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:13,239
harder to both plant and control so we're going to leave those for another day.
