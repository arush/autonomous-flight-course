1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,839
Now that we can follow curved orbits with a lateral directional controller,

2
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,244
we can build a similar cascaded controller for straight line flights.

3
00:00:07,245 --> 00:00:09,330
This controller will be responsible for getting

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,990
the vehicle to the correct altitude and their speed,

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,000
by controlling the elevator deflection and the thrust.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,495
Before we build the longitudinal controller,

7
00:00:17,495 --> 00:00:19,679
notice that we have some redundancy here,

8
00:00:19,679 --> 00:00:21,989
since the pitch and the throttle could each

9
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:24,964
have an effect on the vehicles altitude and their speed.

10
00:00:24,964 --> 00:00:26,774
To handle the redundancy,

11
00:00:26,774 --> 00:00:30,390
we typically divide longitudinal flight into four zones.

12
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,289
In the takeoff zone, we want to climb at a specific pitch angle as quickly as possible.

13
00:00:35,289 --> 00:00:38,030
So, we fly at full throttle and simply

14
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,070
use the elevators to keep our pitch at the desired angle,

15
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,405
how do we know what the pitch angle at takeoff is supposed to be?

16
00:00:44,405 --> 00:00:46,590
It depends on properties of the vehicle,

17
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:48,710
things like the tail clarence which constrains

18
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:51,304
how much the vehicle can pitch, near the ground.

19
00:00:51,304 --> 00:00:54,545
The takeoff angle also depends on what's around the runway.

20
00:00:54,545 --> 00:00:58,900
The vehicle needs to be pitched enough to clear nearby buildings and trees.

21
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:01,835
Once airborne, we enter the climb zone,

22
00:01:01,835 --> 00:01:05,950
here our goal is to climb to the target altitude as quickly as possible.

23
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,144
We still keep the full throttle here,

24
00:01:08,144 --> 00:01:10,644
but now we use our pitch to control the air speed.

25
00:01:10,644 --> 00:01:12,295
For going forward too fast,

26
00:01:12,295 --> 00:01:14,135
we can pitch up and climb faster,

27
00:01:14,135 --> 00:01:15,670
and if we're going too slow,

28
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,769
we can pitch down to avoid stall.

29
00:01:17,769 --> 00:01:20,149
Once we get close to our desired height,

30
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,825
we're in the altitude hold zone.

31
00:01:21,825 --> 00:01:23,740
In this regime, we regulate

32
00:01:23,739 --> 00:01:26,530
our altitude with our pitch and our air speed with a throttle.

33
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,665
This zone is where we'll spend the majority of our flight time.

34
00:01:29,665 --> 00:01:32,625
When the target altitude is well below the vehicle altitude,

35
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,409
we're in the descent zone.

36
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:36,234
This is similar to the climb zone,

37
00:01:36,234 --> 00:01:40,269
except now we set the throttle to zero and use the pitch to control the air speed.

38
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:45,390
Flying in these four zones requires four control loops: pitch attitude hold,

39
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,245
altitude hold using pitch,

40
00:01:47,245 --> 00:01:48,995
airspeed hold using pitch,

41
00:01:48,995 --> 00:01:51,250
and airspeed hold using throttle.

42
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,400
Let's look at each of these loops a little more closely.
