00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,559
The controller you'll implement for the final project will consist of many control loops,

2
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:07,914
some of these will be nested inside other loops while others will not.

3
00:00:07,915 --> 00:00:10,429
Some will have integral terms, some won't.

4
00:00:10,429 --> 00:00:13,199
Some will have derivative terms and others will not.

5
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:15,119
Before we dive into the details of

6
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:19,559
the fixed-wing control architecture that you'll be implementing in the final project,

7
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:24,029
I'd like to discuss a few of the design considerations behind this architecture.

8
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:28,470
We're going to use the same kind of PID loops you saw in the control module,

9
00:00:28,469 --> 00:00:30,599
but not every loop is going to look the same,

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,550
and it's important to understand how we're

11
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,924
making the design decisions of our controllers.

12
00:00:34,924 --> 00:00:38,279
Firstly, we'll get simplicity of design by decoupling

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,140
the longitudinal and lateral control with two separate controllers.

14
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,359
When we get to longitudinal control,

15
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:47,240
we'll use this decoupling strategy again by defining

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,039
separate controllers for separate longitudinal flight regimes.

17
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,619
Secondly, every loop will have a proportional term,

18
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:58,445
but not all will have derivative terms and not all will have integral terms.

19
00:00:58,445 --> 00:01:01,009
We'll also want much more responsive control

20
00:01:01,009 --> 00:01:03,229
on some of the state variables than on others.

21
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,765
We always want the P term since that's the term that

22
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:08,780
actually steers the system towards the desired value.

23
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,049
Integral terms are good to have on the outermost loop of

24
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:15,560
a control system because they can account for any errors in our model,

25
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,945
and they ensure that the system eventually reaches the target state.

26
00:01:18,944 --> 00:01:22,524
But I terms also add instability to the system.

27
00:01:22,525 --> 00:01:25,600
So, in general, we want to avoid adding I terms to

28
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:29,390
inner loop controllers where instability can cause serious problems.

29
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:31,430
Differential terms damp out

30
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:35,020
oscillations and prevent overshoot in systems that have a lot of inertia,

31
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:37,084
but not much inherent damping.

32
00:01:37,084 --> 00:01:40,539
As an example, we'll use a D term in the controller that sets

33
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:44,805
the elevator deflection based on error and pitch because without this term,

34
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:46,705
we'd get more oscillations.

35
00:01:46,704 --> 00:01:49,000
By being careful with how we design

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,540
our control loops and what terms we include in each loop,

37
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,600
we can make the job of tuning a lot easier.
