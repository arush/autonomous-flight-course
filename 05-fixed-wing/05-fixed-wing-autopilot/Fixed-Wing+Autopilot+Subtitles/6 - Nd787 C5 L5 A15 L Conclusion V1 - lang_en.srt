1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
At this point, you're ready for the final project.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,959
In this project, you'll use what you've learned about fixed-wing dynamics and control,

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,769
to implement an autopilot for a fixed-wing vehicle.

4
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:13,869
This autopilot will issue commands to the propulsion system and control surfaces,

5
00:00:13,869 --> 00:00:18,449
to control a fixed-wing vehicle as it navigates from trim state to trim state.

6
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:22,454
The project is broken into scenarios which are meant to help you individually

7
00:00:22,454 --> 00:00:27,070
isolate and tune all of the control loops that you learned about in this lesson.

8
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,780
You don't necessarily need to go through these scenarios in order,

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:33,420
but you'll probably find it easier to converge on

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:37,280
a working set of control parameters if you do. Good luck.
