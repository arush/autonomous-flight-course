1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,304
The nonlinear equations that we came up with earlier looked like this.

2
00:00:04,304 --> 00:00:06,574
If we want to write them more succinctly,

3
00:00:06,575 --> 00:00:10,265
we can gather all of these variables into a vector called x-dot,

4
00:00:10,265 --> 00:00:15,970
and write x-dot equals some function of the state vector x and the control input u.

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:19,155
We want the linearize model around some trim state,

6
00:00:19,155 --> 00:00:21,445
I'm going to call this state x-star.

7
00:00:21,445 --> 00:00:25,574
The controls necessary to maintain this state, I'll call u-star.

8
00:00:25,574 --> 00:00:30,754
Then, we can define deviations from equilibrium as x-bar and u-bar.

9
00:00:30,754 --> 00:00:35,409
So, x-bar is just the actual state x minus the trim state x-star.

10
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:39,089
U-bar is the actual controls minus the controls of trim.

11
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,290
This means we can define the equations of motion around trim by finding x-bar-dot,

12
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:46,960
which is just x-dot minus x-star-dot.

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,179
When you go through the math of linearizing this system,

14
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:52,375
which will present in text below this video,

15
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:54,829
you'll find that x-bar-dot is approximated by

16
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:58,394
Jacobian times the deviation of the state from equilibrium,

17
00:00:58,395 --> 00:01:02,730
plus another Jacobian times the deviation of the controls.

18
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,359
You might remember doing exactly this in building

19
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:09,694
the process model for the extended Kalman filter in the estimation module.

20
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,809
These Jacobians are just matrices,

21
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:13,799
which means we can write the dynamics model as

22
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,530
a linear system around the trim state and trim controls,

23
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,905
where x-bar-dot equals A times x-bar plus B times u-bar.

24
00:01:21,905 --> 00:01:24,754
We call this A matrix the stability matrix,

25
00:01:24,754 --> 00:01:27,894
and we call B the control effect matrix.

26
00:01:27,894 --> 00:01:31,299
Now, remember what x-bar and u-bar represent?

27
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:36,844
They are the deviation of state from trim and the deviation of the controls from trim.

28
00:01:36,844 --> 00:01:40,159
When you saw the strange plots earlier in the lesson,

29
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,179
we weren't changing the controls from their trim values at all.

30
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,505
So, the deviation would have been zero.

31
00:01:45,504 --> 00:01:50,244
This whole B times u term wouldn't have contributed to the dynamics at all.

32
00:01:50,245 --> 00:01:53,359
So, the dynamics are even simpler.

33
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:57,719
We just have the stability matrix times the deviation of the state from trim.

34
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,799
We found this matrix by taking the partial derivatives of

35
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,814
the six state transition functions with respect to the six state variables.

36
00:02:04,814 --> 00:02:07,239
So, it's a six by six square matrix.

37
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:10,009
This square matrix is really what we need to analyze in order

38
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:12,639
to understand the strange plots we saw earlier.
