1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,925
In the previous exercise,

2
00:00:01,925 --> 00:00:04,770
you simulated the longitudinal motion of a vehicle,

3
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:07,764
with an initial state that's very close to a trim state.

4
00:00:07,764 --> 00:00:10,734
When you plotted the pitch rate of that vehicle versus time,

5
00:00:10,734 --> 00:00:13,019
you saw a graph that looked like this.

6
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:15,269
This graph seems pretty strange,

7
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:17,234
and you might have some questions about it.

8
00:00:17,234 --> 00:00:19,824
After all, if we are near an equilibrium state,

9
00:00:19,824 --> 00:00:21,405
where the pitching moment is zero,

10
00:00:21,405 --> 00:00:23,825
why are we seeing this strange oscillation?

11
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:27,304
If we were to build the aircraft that we modeled and actually fly it,

12
00:00:27,304 --> 00:00:28,864
would we see this behavior?

13
00:00:28,864 --> 00:00:31,439
Or, maybe what we're seeing is an artifact of

14
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,390
the discretization that we had to do to simulate this motion on a computer.

15
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,840
Or, if this oscillation is real,

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,560
then we'd like to know more about it.

17
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,280
For example, will these oscillations go away?

18
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,700
If so, how long will it take?

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,425
Can we design our vehicle in a way that minimizes these oscillations?

20
00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:50,914
We'd like to answer all of these questions.

21
00:00:50,914 --> 00:00:53,564
Unfortunately, with the equations written as they are,

22
00:00:53,564 --> 00:00:58,489
we just don't have the mathematical tools necessary to analyze this motion rigorously.

23
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:01,400
It's hard to get the non-linear equations underlying

24
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:04,599
the dynamics of this vehicle to explain what is going on.

25
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:08,125
So, as you've seen a few times in this nanodegree program,

26
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:11,900
we're going to want to turn our non-linear model into a linear model,

27
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:16,280
so we can actually analyze these dynamics and answer these questions.
