1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,419
We have these equations of motion for force-free motion.

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:07,589
Now, we can incorporate the forces and the pitching moment from the previous lesson.

3
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:12,594
Since forces and moments influence accelerations and rotational accelerations,

4
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:15,019
these first three equations will not be changed.

5
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:16,644
Of these last three equations,

6
00:00:16,644 --> 00:00:18,239
q-dot is the easiest.

7
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:20,699
It will just be equal to the pitching moment divided by

8
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,434
the moment of inertia about the y-axis.

9
00:00:23,434 --> 00:00:26,829
We're going to handle u-dot and w-dot similarly.

10
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:31,654
Remember that these give the x and z acceleration of the vehicle in the body frame.

11
00:00:31,655 --> 00:00:34,655
What we're going to do is write the accelerations like this.

12
00:00:34,655 --> 00:00:38,359
We've just added the contributions from Fx and Fz,

13
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:41,939
which represent the total force on the vehicle in its body frame.

14
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:44,119
To figure out what these forces are,

15
00:00:44,119 --> 00:00:46,109
we can imagine a vehicle with some pitch angle,

16
00:00:46,109 --> 00:00:48,484
Theta, and angle of attack, Alpha.

17
00:00:48,484 --> 00:00:50,539
Thrust is aligned to the body frame,

18
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:52,679
weight points down in the inertial frame,

19
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:55,859
which means it's rotated from the body frame by Theta,

20
00:00:55,859 --> 00:01:00,215
and the aerodynamic forces of lift and drag are aligned to the stability frame.

21
00:01:00,215 --> 00:01:02,375
So, they're rotated by Alpha.

22
00:01:02,375 --> 00:01:04,920
If we look at the x component of these forces,

23
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,555
we find that Fx looks like this.

24
00:01:07,555 --> 00:01:10,200
If we look at the z component of these forces,

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,960
we find that Fz looks like this.

26
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:15,979
The lift and drag forces, L and D,

27
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,620
and the pitching moment, M,

28
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:20,805
are all exactly as we define them in the last lesson.

29
00:01:20,805 --> 00:01:26,355
Remember, we have two longitudinal control terms for the elevator deflection and thrust.

30
00:01:26,355 --> 00:01:28,820
You don't see them in these equations because their effect

31
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:31,614
is buried in the specific equations for L,

32
00:01:31,614 --> 00:01:36,449
D, and M. Remember that lift goes away when we exceed the stall angle of attack.

33
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,290
These equations all assume we have laminar flow over the wing.

34
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,920
In the next exercise,

35
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,180
we'll provide you with a longitudinal model

36
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:46,835
for a vehicle that we've implemented in Python.

37
00:01:46,834 --> 00:01:49,549
You'll play around with this model by forward simulating

38
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:52,149
the state of the vehicle when it starts near trim state.

39
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,965
The behavior you see might surprise you.

40
00:01:54,965 --> 00:01:57,469
Take some time to make sure you're comfortable with

41
00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:00,679
these equations before moving on to the next exercise.
