1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:03,600
At this point, we can actually explain

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,570
the strange motion that we saw earlier in this lesson.

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:10,925
The graph we saw for pitch rate versus time looks something like this.

4
00:00:10,925 --> 00:00:15,685
And remember, we generated this graph by putting the vehicle into a near trim state,

5
00:00:15,685 --> 00:00:20,010
and then simulating the motion using unknown linear dynamics model.

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,190
We can explain this motion as the combination of

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,355
two decaying exponentials with oscillations.

8
00:00:26,355 --> 00:00:28,030
One has a long period,

9
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,695
it decays somewhat slowly,

10
00:00:29,695 --> 00:00:34,030
and the other has a much shorter period and decays much more quickly.

11
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:39,859
In fact, this behavior is a real thing and well-known in fixed-wing aircraft design.

12
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:44,340
When you take the eigenvalues of the stability matrix for a realistic aircraft,

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,365
you will get six eigenvalues.

14
00:00:46,365 --> 00:00:48,289
Two of them will be equal to zero,

15
00:00:48,289 --> 00:00:52,859
these just correspond to horizontal and vertical displacement of the aircraft.

16
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:58,545
The remaining four eigenvalues comes two conjugate pairs of complex numbers.

17
00:00:58,545 --> 00:01:01,250
One pair of eigenvalues corresponds to

18
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,305
this short period motion and is typically called a short period response.

19
00:01:05,305 --> 00:01:07,730
It's a transient oscillation and very quickly

20
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:11,245
dies out as the aircraft returns to the trim state.

21
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:16,719
The other pair of eigenvalues corresponds to this slower and longer term oscillation,

22
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:18,825
this motion is called phugoid.

23
00:01:18,825 --> 00:01:20,750
On aircraft that carry passengers,

24
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:23,965
this phugoid can feel like a gentle rolling motion.

25
00:01:23,965 --> 00:01:28,094
Ideally, the aircraft will be designed to minimize the amplitude of phugoid,

26
00:01:28,094 --> 00:01:31,920
but it can occur when moving from trim state to trim state.

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,079
When working with real aircraft,

28
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,950
it's important to recognize phugoid and understand what's happening.

29
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:43,020
For example, adding control inputs to counteract the phugoid motion directly can

30
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:48,319
sometimes make things worse in a process known as pilot induced oscillation.
