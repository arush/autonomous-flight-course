00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,174
Welcome back. In this lesson,

2
00:00:02,174 --> 00:00:05,689
we're going to analyze a longitudinal motion of fixed-wing vehicles.

3
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:09,720
We're going to start by using the equations we developed in the last lesson,

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,060
to write down the non-linear equations of motion

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,910
for the longitudinal motion of a fixed-wing vehicle.

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,100
These non-linear equations will be really

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,540
useful when we're trying to simulate fixed-wing flight,

8
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:23,839
but not as useful for actually analyzing an aircraft's actual motion.

9
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:27,149
To do useful mathematical analysis of fixed-wing flight,

10
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:31,399
we'll need to first linearize the equations of motion around a trim state.

11
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:33,129
Once we have a linear model,

12
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,120
we'll use some of the tools of linear algebra to answer

13
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:41,239
some important questions about the motion and stability of fixed-wing vehicles.
